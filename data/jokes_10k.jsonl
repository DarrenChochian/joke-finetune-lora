Not being suited for shepherding, it was very tiring for the sheep doing the work, and was stressful for the sheep being driven, too. One day, a new ram was introduced to the flock. He thought this was a very curious arrangement. He said to one of the other rams, \"Why are we in charge of keeping order amongst the ewes, and they in charge of keeping order amongst the rams? Doesn't this mutual antagonism engender animosity when mating season comes around?\" The other ram replied, \"Like it or not, we always herd the ones we love.\""}

No!\" As promised, the man's penis shrunk to 12 inches! But it was still too big for him to be comfortable with, so he asked again, \"Magic toad, please won't you have sex with me?\" The toad once again made a face and croaked, \"Ew, no!\" and the man's penis shrunk to 9 inches.

I then casually left the building, got in his car and moved it out of sight, and spread the glass all over the ground where his window was. And then at lunch, as he was walking out of the building, I told the office staff to look out the window and watch him get in his car. He walks out to where his car was, looks around confused to not see his car. He gets closer. He looks at the ground and sees the glass, and I swear we all watched his soul leave his body. His head drooped down to his feet and he walked back to the office, probably thinking he had to call the police and report a stolen car. As soon as he opened the door, we were all standing in the hall way laughing. It took him a minute to figure it out, but he looked straight at me and gave chase yelling all kinds of obscenities. It was a fucking GREAT DAY!"}

The frog warned her, \"You do realize that this wish will also make your husband the most handsome man in the world, an Adonis, that women will flock to.\" The woman replied, \"That will be okay because I will be the most beautiful woman and he will only have eyes for me.\" So, KAZAM she's the most beautiful woman in the world! For her second wish, she wanted to be the richest woman in the world. The frog said, \"That will make your husband the richest man in the world and he will be ten times richer than you.\" The woman said, \"That will be okay because what's mine is his and what's his is mine.\" So, KAZAM she's the richest woman in the world!

He proceeded to take out a hose and stick it in the cow's butt. He then told the farmer to go around and watch the cow's eyes. As the farmer was watching the vet took a deep breath and blew into the hose. To the farmer's amazement the cow's eyes went back to normal. The vet said that'll be $200. The farmer was a bit taken aback by the steep charge, but he was thankful that his cow was back to normal, so he paid the vet without complaint. The next day, he went out to milk the cow as usual. To his great dismay he found that the cow's eyes were crossed again! He didn't feel like paying the vet again though, so he decided to treat the cow himself. He began to do the same procedure to the cow exactly as he saw the vet do it the day before. However he could not see if it was having the same effect. So he called Billy-Bob the farm hand over and said, \"I want you to watch the cow's eyes while I blow in this hose.\" Billy-Bob agreed and watched as farmer Brown did the deed. However, nothing happened. He reported to the farmer who tried it again. Still, no result. Farmer Brown was stumped, so he told Billy-Bob to blow while he watched the eyes. As farmer Brown moved to the front, he saw Billy-Bob take out the hose and turned it around! Just before he put it to his lips, the farmer yelled, \"What the hell are you doing?!\" Billy-Bob looked at him incredulously and said, \"You don't think I am gonna put my mouth on the same end of the pipe that you had your on.\""}

You should come by!” So he finishes with work, and goes home. He tidied up, gets dressed, and gets ready for the party. 8pm rolls by, and he gets to the address. It’s got a neon sign labeled “The Joke.” He doesn’t know anyone there except for the frosted cheerio, and he just kind of wants to leave. She comes up to him and says: “So glad you could come! Are you having a good time?” “Not really. I don’t know anyone here except for you. I think I’m just gonna get some punch.” He says. “Ooh, grab me a glass, would you?” She says. So he goes up to the table with all the drinks and snacks and such, but there isn’t anyone there. He grabs two glasses and promptly gets back to the frosted cheerio. “So, how’d it go?” Says the frosted cheerio. “Smoothly. There wasn’t even a line.” He replies. “Really?” She has a look of pure astonishment for some reason. “Yeah. The joke doesn’t have a punchline.”"}
{"prompt": "what a set up, for a dad joke. it's worth it tho", "completion": "full disclosure, this isn't my joke, was sent to me I knew a bloke who was a massive fan of tractors his whole life. When he was a kid, he didn't have toy cars or posters of lambos on his bedroom wall, he had toy tractors and trailers and posters of the latest John Deeres. He didn't go on holiday to Spain, France or even the Lake District. No, his family holidays were centred around the agricultural shows, especially the Great Yorkshire Show and the Appleby Show. Sometimes, the tractor salesmen would even let him go for a ride on a tractor while they moved them about the ground! As he grew up, his love for tractors never waned or faded, and was just as strong on his wedding day as when he was a child, to the point, he didn't have wedding cars, but tractors! On his honeymoon, he and his new wife travelled north to stay at Appleby Manor Hotel and go to the show, telling everyone that they were honeymooning. One of the salesmen, who'd known him for years, asked if he'd like to drive his new wife around the showground in the newest machine. Obviously, he leapt at the chance! To take control of a tractor? This was a dream come true! So, he and his wife climbed aboard and he drove a full circuit of the ground, loving every single second. Of course, it couldn't last forever and all too soon, they got back to the salesman. They jumped down and thanked the salesman gratefully. The salesman asked if they'd like a photo with the tractor. Of course, they said yes and they stood next to the tractor, he with his hand on the step in front of the big wheel and his wife to the outside. Unknown to anyone, he had forgotten to put the handbrake on and a sudden gust of wind, combined with the slight incline the tractor was on caused it to roll forward. Before anyone realised what was happening, he'd slipped on the grass and the big wheel had run straight over him. The Great North Air Ambulance service was in attendance and flew him straight to the Cumberland Infirmary at Carlisle. Nearly every bone in his body was broken, several of organs were damaged and he had huge internal bleeding. It took hours of surgery to stabilise his condition, followed by a medically induced coma lasting several weeks and repeated surgical treatments to realign bones and repair what damage they could. He then was put into an intense physiotherapy regime to teach him to walk and rebuild the strength he had lost over the past six months. Obviously, all this time in the hospital gave him a lot of time to think about his life and he came to the realisation that being such a huge fan of tractors had been a massive waste of time and had, in the end, cost him a lot more than it had ever been worth. He vowed, silently, to leave his obsession behind and move on with a more normal life. As he laid in his hospital bed, day after day, week after week, month after month, subsisting on the hospital food and whatever his beloved and devoted wife bought to him, he realised that when he got out of there, what he really fancied was a proper pie and a pint in a proper pub. So when the day came, and he was finally discharged from the loving care of the infirmary, he hurpled on his stick across the road to the pub he'd seen. He got his pint from the bar, ordered a steak and ale pie with creamy mash, peas and gravy and took a seat at a table next to the window. He was sipping away, soaking up the ambiance and listening to the old man at the end of the bar put the world to rights, when the door to the kitchen flew open and a huge billow of smoke plumed into the bar and filled the room. Everyone was panicking, trying to get out of the pub, but not my mate. He just calmly stood up, using the table for support and opened the window. He turned his head into the smoke and inhaled deeply, turned back to the window and blew out. He did this twice more and the smoke was gone. Everyone just stopped and looked at him. After a moment the bartender spoke, “How the fuck did you do that???” “Easy,” replied my friend, as he took his seat and picked up his pint, “I'm an ex tractor fan.”"}

{"prompt": "Surprise", "completion": "Once there lived a woman who had a maddening passion for baked beans. She loved them but unfortunately, they had always had a very embarrassing and somewhat lively reaction to her. Then one day she met a man and fell in love. When it became apparent that they would marry she thought to herself, \"He is such a sweet and gentle man, he would never go for this carrying on.\" She made the supreme sacrifice and gave up beans. Some months ater her car broke down on the way home from work. Since she lived in the country she called her husband and told him that she would be late because she had to walk home. On her way, she passed a small diner and the odor of the baked beans was more than she could stand. Since she still had miles to walk, she figured that she would walk off any ill effects by the time she reached home. So, she stopped at the diner and before she knew it, she had consumed three large orders of baked beans. All the way home she putt-putted, and upon arriving home she felt reasonably sure she could control it. Her husband seemed excited to see her and exclaimed delightedly, \"Darling, I have a surprise for dinner tonight.\" He then blindfolded her and led her to her chair at the table. She seated herself and just as he was about to remove the blindfold from his wife, the telephone rang. He made her promise not to touch the blindfold until he returned. He then went to answer the telephone. The baked beans she had consumed were still affecting her and the pressure was becoming almost unbearable, so while her husband was out of the room she seized the opportunity, shifted her weight to one leg and let it go. It was not only loud, but it smelled like a fertilizer truck running over a skunk in front of pulpwood mill. She took her napkin and fanned the air around her vigorously. Then, she shifted to the other cheek and ripped three more, which reminded her of cooked cabbage. Keeping her ears tuned to the conversation in the other room, she went on like this for another ten minutes. When the telephone farewells signaled the end of her freedom, she fanned the air a few more times with her napkin, placed it on her lap and folded her hands upon it, smiling contentedly to herself. She was the picture of innocence when her husband returned, apologizing for taking so long, he asked her if she peeked, and she assured him that she had not. At this point, he removed the blindfold, and she was surprised!!! There were twelve dinner guests seated around the table to wish her a \"Happy Birthday\"!!!"}

The ugly lady undresses, puts a blindfold on, and hands him a condom. He takes a corn on the cob from the pantry and inserts it into the lady, using it as a dildo. The lady screams and moans while the man is trying not to gag from the smell. After she orgasms, he throws the corn on the cob out of the window and stuffs the unused condom in his pocket. Lady: “Wow that was absolutely amazing. Here is some meatloaf and a thermos of iced tea. My phone is on the countertop right over there” After making some phone calls to his family and checking the gps to figure out how to get home, he walks outside with the meatloaf and some cold tea and walks around the corner of the house to find his friends. Man #3: “Hey guys, look how good this meatloaf looks!” Man #2: “Man, I don’t know about you. But we just shared the best buttered corn in our lives!”"}

Thomas stepped in first. He was a philosopher so he said, “OK, give me the most comprehensive report on Socrates’ Socrates’ teachings.” With a snap of his finger, a stack of paper appeared next to St Peter. The philosopher read it and concluded it was correct. “Then, you are going to Hell!” Arthur was next. He was a mathematician so he asked, \"Give me the most complicated formula ever theorized!” With a snap of his finger, another stack of paper appeared next to St Peter. The mathematician read it and reluctantly agreed it was correct. “Then, you are going to Hell!” Finally, Frank stepped in. He asked St peter to bring him a chair and he brought forward a chair. Frank asked him to drill 20 holes on the chair, he did just that. Frank then sat on the chair and let out a very loud fart. Standing up, he asked, “Which hole did my fart come out from?” St. Peter inspected the seat and said, \"The third hole from the top-right.” “Wrong,” said Frank, “It’s wrong.” “It came out from my asshole.” And Frank went to Heaven."}

He cried and threw his hands in the air; he screamed and shouted with despair. \"Could anyone help?\" Then he started with a yelp. There was another man, but trust him, he dare? \"I gotchu,\" the man said with a grin. \"Come on, I'll help you, hop in.\" He got in his car, they drove pretty far: for the traveler, it seemed a big win.

I make sure his drink is ready before he comes in.\" The guy seemed impressed by the bartender's efficiency. He came back the next few days at 4:30, and watched as the bartender made an almond daiquiri for the surgeon. And every day, the surgeon came in precisely at 5:00 pm, drank the daiquiri, and left without saying a word. One afternoon, the bartender started to make the drink, but realized he was out of almonds. \"What am I going to do?\" he asked himself as he searched throughout the bar for almonds. He found some hickory nuts, and figured that the surgeon wouldn't notice the difference. So, he mixed up the drink with the hickory nuts, and placed in at the end of the bar. Sure enough, at 5:00 pm, the surgeon walked into the bar and picked up his drink. With one sip, he knew something was amiss and he said, \"What's going on? This isn't my usual drink.\" The bartender said, \"Well, that's a hickory daiquiri, doc.\""}

I'll just keep an eye on them so there's no trouble. So he follows them. The elderly couple walks haltingly along, leaning on each other for support aided by walking sticks. Finally, they get to the back of the tavern and make their way to the fence The old lady lifts her skirt and the old man drops his trousers. As she leans against the fence, the old man moves in.. Then suddenly they erupt into the most furious sex that the policeman has ever seen. This goes on for about ten minutes while both are making loud noises and moaning and screaming. Finally, they both collapse, panting on the ground. The policeman is amazed. He thinks he has learned something about life and old age that he didn't know. After about half an hour of lying on the ground recovering, the old couple struggle to their feet and put their clothes back on. The policeman, is still watching and thinks to himself, this is truly amazing, I've got to ask them what their secret is. So, as the couple passes, he says to them, \"Excuse me, but that was something else. You must've had a fantastic sex life together. Is there some sort of secret to this?\" Shaking, the old man is barely able to reply, \"Fifty years ago that wasn't an electric fence.\""}

Cow thinks it's pretty cool, and wants to learn how to play the bass guitar. Cow goes to the phone book, looks up a music teacher and calls him. \"Hi, I'd like to learn to play bass guitar.\" Says the cow. \"Sure,\" says the man on the phone. \"Just come to your lesson and we'll get you started.\" \"There's just one problem,\" says the cow. \"I'm a cow.\" \"Not to worry,\" the man says. \"We have new state of the art technology to teach cows.

He goes up to the animals and says \"hey, you guys are pretty good! I'm from a record label, I'd like to sign you!\" The band records an album, puts out some singles and becomes a massive success. They go on a worldwide tour and make tons of money. Right before the last show of the tour, which is supposed to be in Vegas, Horse gets a call. His mother is in hospital. Horse goes to visit her before the show while the rest of the band goes to Vegas to set up. It turns out that she's all good, it's just a cold. As horse is leaving the hospital, he gets another call. The private jet that was carrying the band and their producer crashed into the ocean, and there were no survivors. Horse is devastated. All of his best friends are dead, he's out of a job and he's stuck with nowhere to go. He breaks down in tears and decides he'll drink himself to death. So the horse walks into a bar. The bartender asks, \"why the long face?\""}

{"prompt": "Engineers take a bow!", "completion": "During the development of a new jet fighter aircraft the wings on the prototypes kept snapping off where they joined the fuselage. The test-pilots who only barely survived by ejecting in time were terrified. No amount of re-design seem to solve the problem, so the aircraft company in desperation offered its employees a huge reward to come up with diagnoses. To the surprise of the top engineers, old Jenkins the janitor meekly said he had an idea. Well, desperation breeds opportunities, so they asked him to explain. In reply he merely requested a power drill, and when supplied one he climbed onto the wings of the latest prototype and proceeded to make holes a few inches apart where the wings joined the fuselage. \"Now, get your test pilot to fly the fighter\", Jenkins advised. Sceptical, but curious, the engineers did. Lo! The jet fighter passed with flying (pun intended) colors. No more wing snapping. Amazed, the engineers surrounded Jenkins amidst all the celebration and asked him how he had hit upon such a clever solution that evaded all the engineering brains. Here is Jenkins' response. \"Ladies and gentlemen, even though I did not not have the benefit of university training like you, I am an observant chappie. You see, as janitor one of my duties is to change the toilet rolls in the loos when they run low. Now, you know how toliet paper has rows of holes separating sheets?

When he gets to the bottom he sees a crowd of people gathered around and pushes his way thru to the bruised and battered body. Someone says \"Father do you know this man?\", and the priest answers\"No, but his face rings a bell!\""}

The man looks down at his chest and sees that there is blood coming out. He looks at his wife and says “Shot through the heart! And you’re to blame, darling you gave love a bad name!”"}

They immediately impounded the aircraft and hauled the pilot into an interrogation room. The pilot’s story was that he took off from Vegas, got lost, and spotted the Base just as he was about to run out of fuel. The Air Force started a full FBI background check on the pilot and held him overnight during the investigation. By the next day, they were finally convinced that the pilot really was lost and wasn’t a spy. They gassed up his airplane, gave him a terrifying “you-did-not-see-a-base” briefing, complete with threats of spending the rest of his life in prison, told him Vegas was that-a-way on such-and-such a heading, and sent him on his way. The day after that though, to the total disbelief of the Air Force, the same Cessna showed up again. Once again, the MP’s surrounded the plane… only this time there were two people in the plane. The same pilot jumped out and said, “Do anything you want to me, but my wife is in the plane and you have to tell her where I was last night!”"}

The kid is already vaccinated.\" The doctor said: \"No, I assure you that according to official records, your kid is most certainly not vaccinated. Do you have any documents proving the child is vaccinated?\" The mom said: \"Yes, the proof is that my child is alive.\" The doctor was like: \"Pardon me?\" The mom explains: \"Vaccines saves lives, and children without vaccines die. It is hard, scientific fact that no child can survive without vaccination, so the fact my child is alive proves he is vaccinated.\" The doctor said: \"I'm sorry, but you must have heard some misinformation.

A child being alive is not proof that he or she is vaccinated.\" The mom was shocked: \"I can't believe they would let an ANTI-VAXXER be a doctor! You're one of those idiots that believe children could survive without vaccines? What do you take me for, an idiot? You are the reason all these children don't get vaccinated. Not only should you lose your license, you should go to jail.\" The doctor said: \"No, ma'am. I'm very pro-vaccination. I've performed thousands of vaccinations just last year. I'm just sticking to the facts. You need to get your child vaccinated.\" The mom screamed: \"We have an anti-vax doctor in the house! He's trying to convince me that children can survive without vaccines!!\" The entire hospital went up in arms. What? An anti-vaxxer doctor working in the hospital spreading misinformation? The entire hospital chanted: \"Throw him out! Throw him out!\" After they threw out the doctor and everyone who supported him, the hospital thanked the mother for her service in helping spreading the benefits of vaccination. \"Remember, vaccination saves lives.\" Said the mother. \"But we have much work to do.

{"prompt": "Three kingdoms border a lake in the shape of an obtuse triangle", "completion": "One kingdom lies on each side of the lake. For decades, the king's had argued over it's true owner, each claiming to be the first kingdom to settle there, and many tales of magical swords and godly favours to claim divine right. Eventually, this storytelling and legal battling came to no conclusion, so the kings decided to go to war. The first kingdom is very wealthy, and has a grand army of thousands of Knights in shining armour with state of the art squires and weaponry, expertly trained killing machines. The second kingdom is moderately well off, and has several hundred Knights in standard armour with enough squires to get by, but all willing in heart and mind. The third kingdom is very poor, and has only one elderly Knight with his great grandson for a squire, in rusty centuries old armour. On the eve before the battle, each kingdom decides to have a celebration for the great deeds that are about to be done. The first kingdom has a great banquet that no words can give justice to, a massive, endless hall of food and delight, dancers and jesters and bards as plentiful as the fine wine and boar that accompanies them. The second kingdom has not nearly as grand an occasion, but makes the most of what they have, making up for the lack of fine food and entertainment with enough ale to knock out an elephant. The third kingdom has but scraps to make do with. In fact, so little food do they have that there is only enough for the Knight and boy squire alone to have a feast (a feast by their standards, at least). The elderly Knight is too weak and tired to get up, so the squire prepares the meal. He decides to cook a stew, so hangs a pot over a fire with a noose and cooks what they have into a small broth. Finally, the great day dawns. The kings did not sleep through the night, and sent their generals to ready their armies. The world sat on tenterhooks. However, fate had taken a strange turn. The armies from the first and second kingdoms had drunk so much in their revels that not one remained conscious, much to the fury of their leaders. And in the third kingdom, the elderly Knight's back had perished due to old age. The kings were left speechless. There was only one option. The squires must go to war. So on the battlefield, a hundred thousand squires in tunics too big for them and wooden swords trampled the ground beneath them as they came to the edge. One gigantic behemoth of an army met the other small but willing force at the peak of the lake. And the squire of the third kingdom faced them all. The battle began. Heads were clubbed in, backs broken, knees twisted, hair pulled, and slowly the numbers remaining dwindled. As the hours swept by and the body piles grew high, the kings and their people watched in the greatest suspense the lake ever knew. And as the sun set, and the dust cleared, finally, a single figure stood atop the mountain of bodies beneath him, victorious. The squire of the third kingdom had won. This goes to show that the squire of the high-pot-and-noose is greater than the sum of the squires of the other two sides of the triangle."}

August 15: Set up a tent in the camping department and told the children shoppers he'd invite them in if they would bring pillows and blankets from the bedding department to which twenty children obliged. 8. August 23: When a clerk asked if they could help him he began crying and screamed, 'Why can't you people just leave me alone?' EMTs were called. 9. September 4: Looked right into the security camera and used it as a mirror while he picked his nose. 10. September 10: While handling guns in the hunting department, he asked the clerk where the antidepressants were. 11. October 3: Darted around the store suspiciously while, loudly humming the, 'Mission Impossible' theme. 12. October 6: In the auto department, he practiced his, 'Madonna Look' using different sizes of funnels. 13. October 18: Hid in a clothing rack and when people browsed through, yelled 'PICK ME! PICK ME!' 14. October 22: When an announcement came over the loud speaker, he assumed a fetal position and screamed; 'OH NO! IT'S THOSE VOICES AGAIN!' 15. Took a box of condoms to the checkout clerk and asked where is the fitting room? And last, but not least: 16. October 23: Went into a fitting room, shut the door, waited awhile; then yelled very loudly, 'Hey! There's no toilet paper in here.' One of the clerks passed out."}

My captors continue to taunt me with bizarre little dangling objects. They dine lavishly on fresh meat, while the other inmates and I are fed hash or some sort of dry nuggets. Although I make my contempt for the rations perfectly clear, I nevertheless must eat something in order to keep up my strength. The only thing that keeps me going is my dream of escape. In an attempt to disgust them, I once again vomit on the carpet. Today I decapitated a mouse and dropped its headless body at their feet. I had hoped this would strike fear into their hearts, since it clearly demonstrates what I am capable of. However, they merely made condescending comments about what a ‘good little hunter’ I am. There was some sort of assembly of their accomplices tonight. I was placed in solitary confinement for the duration of the event. However, I could hear the noises and smell the food. I overheard that my confinement was due to the power of ‘allergies.’ I must learn what this means and how to use it to my advantage. Today I was almost successful in an attempt to assassinate one of my tormentors by weaving around his feet as he was walking. I must try this again tomorrow — but at the top of the stairs. I am convinced that the other prisoners here are flunkies and snitches. The dog receives special privileges. He is regularly released - and seems to be more than willing to return. He is obviously retarded. The bird has got to be an informant. I observe him communicating with the guards regularly. I am certain that he reports my every move. My captors have arranged protective custody for him in an elevated cell, so he is safe. For now..."}

I travel around the world, speaking at various software engineering conferences. I was recently invited to speak at the premier aviation conference in the world on the subject of writing safety critical software. I need to be engaging, bring in the audience, and make it all feel personal and real. As usual, I started off with a pretty standard presentation, introducing myself, establishing credibility, talking about the subject matter. But about 15 minutes in, I had everyone in the audience stand up, then I outline a new, hypothetical project and tell them they must evaluate it. I gave them the specifications of an aircraft and a deadline at which the project must be completed. I then told them I would ask them a few questions, and if their answer was \"no\", they could sit down, but if their answer was \"yes\", they remain standing. \"Would your marketing department would sell this package?\" Everybody remained standing. \"Could your team deliver this on time?\" About half of the audience sat down. At this point, I knew I had them. \"Would you be willing to put yourself, your friends, and your family on this plane's first flight?\" At this point, the audience kind of grins at each other sheepishly, and slowly everyone sits down. But this time, one man remained standing. I saw this as a great opportunity, fully expecting a discussion about software testing, or something like that, so I asked him, \"You, sir! Tell me, why is that you alone among all of these people have the courage and confidence to put your loved ones on the line?\" To which he responded, \"If my team wrote that software, the plane would never get off the ground!\""}

Going to the local general store by his new homestead, he asks where he can get some animals. The owner tells him to go to Old Man Murphy’s farm down the road a ways and he will get him all set up with a few animals. Excited the man heads over to the farm. Upon meeting, Old Man Murphy says to the gentleman I can definitely tell you’re a city slicker- Don’t worry, in time you’ll settle in and be just like one of us. The gentleman than asks well, how about that little hen over there. Maybe I can purchase it from you. Surely that would be a great animal to start with. Old Man Murphy says sure, I’ll sell you that one. But, just so you know young hens are actually called pullets. The gentleman sees a donkey off to the side and says well, that looks like a great animal to have at my new farm they are actually called an ass, right? How about I buy him from you. Old Man Murphy says now you’re starting to sound like a farmer. Yes, I’ll sell him to you but, he’s kind of stubborn. Sometimes he just lays down and won’t move. If you scratch on his back a bit he will get right back up and moving. Lastly, the gentleman says well no farm would be complete without a rooster. How about that one right there. Old Man Murphy says sure but, just so you know a rooster is actually called a cock. The gentlemen says oh yeah that makes sense. He thanks Old Man Murphy and starts the walk back to his own farm holding the birds and leading the donkey. About halfway back to his farm the donkey lays down in the middle of the road when suddenly a shiny red sports car pulls up with a beautiful woman driving. A little aggravated that she can’t pass by because of the animal blocking her way. She scoffs at the gentleman. He looks at her and said I’ll get him out of the way in just minute ma’am but, I need a favor to make that happen. She hesitantly says ok. The gentleman says.... will you hold my cock and pullet while I scratch my ass?"}

On this farm, there's a cow, a chicken, and a horse, and the three of them are best friends. They do just about everything together. And one day, they're sitting at the window of the house, and the farmer's kid is watching MTV, and they're watching it, and they hear the music, and the horse says \"you know what? I'm gonna learn how to do that.\" So the horse calls up Guitar Center, and he says to the guy on the phone, \"Hey, listen. I wanna learn to play guitar.\" Guy on the phone says \"no problem. Come on down.\" \"No, there might be one problem. I'm a horse.\" \"Naw, it ain't a problem. We'll get some attachments, I can teach you to play. Promise.\" So horse turns out to be a natural. He gets GOOD. And he calls over Cow and Chicken and he's like \"LOOK WHAT I CAN DO\" and he jams out like Jimi Hendrix. And Cow says \"holy shit. That's awesome. I want to learn to do something like that too. What's like that?\" And horse says \"Bass. Learn to play bass.\" So Cow calls up Guitar Center, and she says \"Hey, listen, I wanna learn to play bass guitar.\" Guy on the phone says \"No problem, miss, come on down.\" \"Eh, this might be a problem. I'm a cow.\" \"Nah, no problem. I helped a horse recently, I can teach you to play too. Promise.\" So Cow learns to play the bass, and Cow is fucking amazing at it. So Cow and Horse are jamming, and Chicken gets a bit jealous. He says \"Damn, I wanna learn something too. But not like that.\" Horse says \"Well, I mean, we need a drummer around here.\" So Chicken calls up Guitar Center, and he says \"Hey, listen, I wanna learn to play drums.\" Guy on the phone says \"No problem, man. Come on down.\" \"Eh, maybe a problem. I'm a chicken.\" \"Naw. Ain't no thing. I taught a horse guitar and a cow bass. I can teach you drums.\" So chicken learns the drums, and he's fucking amazing. So Cow, Horse, and Chicken all start having jam sessions whenever the farmer's out. And one day they're playing, and a big record agent is driving down the road. And he hears them, and he's like \"what the fuck? that sounds amazing.\" so he stops at the farm, and he finds them all playing in the barn. And he says \"Holy shit. You guys sound AWESOME. I wanna represent you, make this a real band, make some music. You're gonna be HUGE.\" So Cow and Chicken and Horse take this guy's deal, and they move to the city, they cut albums, and they're big. REAL big. Top 10 hits, platinum albums, the works. They get set for their first tour. But there's a problem, see. Horse gets a phone call, his mom's real sick. Cow and Chicken, though, they're cool as hell. They say \"Listen. Go see your mom. We'll delay the first show a couple of days, so fly back home, spend some time with her, and then jump on a plane and come meet us.\" Horse says \"Thanks, guys. you're the best,\" and he takes off. Couple of days later, Horse's mom is just fine. Turned out to be a real bad cold, she gets over it, and he spends another night there. The following morning, he gets a call. It's his agent. Cow and Chicken's plane went down, they died in the crash. The band is done. he's lost his best friends. And horse, this breaks him, man. He's been through so much with them, and he feels real down in the dumps. So he takes a walk, and while he's on that walk, he just can't shake the blue, so he figures to himself \"Alright, alright. One drink, just to get over it.\" So Horse walks into the local bar. Bartender looks at him and says \"Hey. Why the long face?\""}

Being free for the first time i started to celebrate. Ate bacon my first day, had Hindu friends in a week, and within the month i had even met a girl. I was shy and awkward as i could possibly be but she liked me and thought i was funny. She was a little too hipster punk for me, listing to music i've never heard and using words like tubular and bae, but i loved it. Within two months we were dating. It was going great until my father heard about it. The Hindus and bacon he could overlook, but the women to him were really wrong. To him this was too much and he even claimed me of having sex with her. As if it couldn't get any weirder he actually demanded i show him my penis to prove i haven't been having sex. I had to ask him twice to make sure i heard him right. It was awkward but living under his roof i had to do as he commands. I started to go out with her on dates and every time i came home i had to whip it out for dad. It might be insane, but i actually am ok with dicks out for haram bae."}

{"prompt": "In a small American town, a band of squirrels had become quite a problem.", "completion": "The Presbyterian church called a meeting to decide what to do about their squirrel infestation. After much prayer and consideration, they concluded that the squirrels were predestined to be there, and they shouldn't interfere with God's divine will. At the Baptist church the squirrels had taken an interest in the baptistery. The deacons met and decided to put a water-slide on the baptistery and let the squirrels drown themselves. The squirrels liked the slide and unfortunately, knew instinctively how to swim, so twice as many squirrels showed up the following week. The Lutheran church decided that they were not in a position to harm any of God's creatures. So, they humanely trapped their squirrels and set them free near the Baptist church. Two weeks later the squirrels were back when the Baptists took down the water-slide. The Episcopalians tried a much more unique path by setting out pans of whiskey around their church in an effort to kill the squirrels with alcohol poisoning. They sadly learned how much damage a band of drunk squirrels can do. But the Catholic church came up with a more very creative strategy! They baptized all the squirrels and made them members of the church. Now they only see them at Christmas and Easter. And not much was heard from the Jewish synagogue. They took the first squirrel and circumcised him. They haven't seen a squirrel since"}

{"prompt": "Head Larger Than The Shaft...", "completion": "Several years ago, Great Britain funded a study to determine why the head on a man's penis is larger than the shaft. The study took two years and cost over 1.2 million pounds. The study concluded that the reason the head of a man's penis is larger than the shaft is to provide the man with more pleasure during sex. After the results were published, France decided to conduct their own study on the same subject. They were convinced that the results of the British study were incorrect. After three years of research at a cost of in excess of 2 million Euros, the French researchers concluded that the head of a man's penis is larger than the shaft to provide the woman with more pleasure during sex. When the results of the French study were released, Australia decided to conduct their own study. The Aussies didn't really trust British or French studies. So, after nearly three hours of intensive research and a cost of right around 75 dollars (three cases of beer), the Aussie study was complete. They concluded that the reason the head on a man's penis is larger than the shaft is to prevent your hand from flying off and hitting you in the forehead."}

{"prompt": "My father ladies and gentlemen...", "completion": "So, when we were younger we used to run a single line off the back of one of the snowmobiles, put a splitter on her with two lengths of ski rope about 25' long, gear up with helmets and suits, and throw two guys on on those flying saucers, (you know, like the ones on National Lampoon's Vacation) and then the sled driver would just “giver” down some snow covered back roads. Holding the rope with one hand you could steer the saucer by leaning. Object of the game was to knock the other guy off, preferably when he was on or near what were sometimes 10' embankments of ploughed snow at the side of the road. Hell of a lot of harmless fun for the most part, until one day it went bad. Paul and I had been bashing the hell out of each other for a while, and no one was coming off. I came at him quickly from my side of the road and made the initial impact with him just seconds before an old Ford Econoline “shagging wagon” with the classic big ole cb antenna on it, came round the bend in front of us. Long enough story short, I managed to stay over in our lane behind the sled, but as fate and all the timing that goes with it would have it, the van came even with us just as Paul bounced up the embankment, off a tree, and flipped over, on the wrong side of the road. Again, in a horrible twist of fate, he came down near the top of the van’s windshield, and the motion of the impact basically impaled him on the antenna that was jutting up from the top of the van. He survived the initial impact but later died in hospital. His blood system was poisoned by some ailment related to the dead insects that had beat him to the antenna. Maybe if he had had a flak jacket on he might have made it. Be careful out there folks. We all did some pretty risky stuff when we were younger. Wear protection. No one wants to die from a van aerial disease....."}

The third week, she's 15 minutes late, which irritates the guys. This week she plays right-handed and narrowly beats all three of them. The men grumble that her late arrival is petty gamesmanship on her part. However, she's so charming and complimentary of their strong play, they can't hold a grudge. This woman is a riddle no one can figure out. They have a couple of beers in the Clubhouse and finally, one of the men asks her, \"How do you decide if you're going to golf right-handed or left-handed?\" The lady blushes, and grins. \"When my dad taught me to play golf, I learned that I was ambidextrous.\" she replies. \"I like to switch back and forth.\" \"When I got married after college, I discovered my husband always sleeps in the nude. From then on, I developed a silly habit. Right before I leave in the morning for golf practice, I pull the covers off him. If his willie points to the right, I golf right-handed; if it points to the left, I golf left-handed.\" The guys think this is hysterical.

{"prompt": "They kept on bidding...", "completion": "In early 2009, a laboratory decided to do a free giveaway of a virus plushie to the kids in the surrounding region. The plushie had several taped messages inside, telling children how to wash their hands properly and practice proper hygienic standards set bt the WHO. The parents of the kids were overjoyed to know this, and within days, the plush toy had already sold out. The laboratory took this as a success and was took over by more requests. They transitioned into a toy company as a result. In December 2019, one of the plush toys went on auction in Wuhan, China. The proceeds would be donated to an American charity. The auctioneer spoke. \"Alright, our starting price is $100. Anyone have $110? $115?\" One spoke up. \"$120!\" \"$120, any more? Going once!\" \"$150!\", a second one popped. A third one came in as quickly as the second, bidding $160. Then a fourth, a fifth... ... \"$2000!\" \"$2010!\", the eighteenth bidder stated. \"It's going good. Anybody else bidding?\" A woman spoke. \"$2020!\" Another voice popped up beside the person who had said it. It was her father. \"Yeah, same.\" \"Nice. Nobody? Going once, going twice. And... sold for $2020!\" The auction went quite well, and the plush toy went into the hands of the woman and their father. They were quite hungry afterwards, so they went to the seafood market nearby and bought a bunch of fish. However, the dather felt sick, and they decided to go back to their hotel room while the woman bought some food for them both. Over the next few days, the father's condition worsened. Their breathing got worse, they suffered a fever, and it was decided to bring them to the hospital. After a few days, it was found that he had a new disease, which looked oddly similar to the plushie his daughter had bid for in the auction. This new disease rapidly spread around the world throughout 2020, becoming a pandemic. After becoming the subject of humiliation, the death of his daughter due to the illness, and various death threats, the father realized the laboratory's possible relation to the disease. He analyzed the plushie, and sure enough, traces of the virus causing the disease were on it. He looked up the company and threatened to sue it. The story became embedded in myth, and, centuries later, is still the leading myth on how the Virus of 2020 spread across the world. The man became known not by his name, but by the disease, and the worst mistake he would ever make... He got Co-bid 19."}

I'm Dr. Carradine, and I'll be performing your examination today.\" The new Dr. gives her a reassuring smile, and she's still uncomfortable but tries to go with it. Dr. Michaels had been getting on in years, after all. But then it was Dr. Carradine's turn to look uncomfortable as he began the examination. Mrs. Lewis couldn't figure out why that was, but the new Doctor looked visibly upset the entire time. Finally, she had to know: \"Doctor, is there something wrong?\" \"Well... no. No, everything's fine...\" As the exam went on, though, the new, young Doctor just didn't lose that look of being perturbed by something going on down there. \"Look, tell me what's going on! Right now!\" Karen blurted. The new Doctor sighed, shook his head, and said, \"Well, I... I don't really know how to tell you this. There's nothing *wrong,* exactly, but...\" \"But what!\" \"Well, it's just that you've got the biggest vagina I've ever seen...\" Well, that was it. Karen was seething. She told Dr. Carradine that the examination was *Over*, got her clothing situated, and stormed out of the office. On her way home, though, she started to calm down and think about it. The doctor hadn't been trying to *insult* her... in fact, he'd gone out of his way to keep his mouth shut about what he was seeing until she blustered him into telling her. She decides she'd better have a look for herself. She gets home, goes into the bedroom, then lays the full length mirror in the corner on the floor. She undresses and puts one foot on either side of the mirror, then looks down. Just then, her husband leans around the door frame. \"Hi, honey, whatcha doin'?\" he asks, curious.

A third was found with a tree growing up through his body. The man himself who owned the claim became more and more pale. His eyes became all white. His skin began to give off an overpowering smell of sulfur. He slept all day and at night he wandered the mountain above his claim, coming back each day looking more like a beast than a man. The curse became so bad the last worker alive ran away to the nearest town to tell the authorities what was happening at the claim. In an attempt to save the claim owner's life and lift the curse, a priest was brought in by dogsled to perform an exorcism on the man. A sherriff from the town came with the priest as a bodyguard. The exorcism was long, but apparently successful. Immediately the man's color returned, the sulfur smell disappeared, and he was able to sleep through the night for the first time in six months. After the man awoke, the sherriff immediately arrested the man and brought him back to town with the priest. Standing in front of the judge, the sherriff was asked what charge the law had against the claim owner whose life had just been so dramatically turned around.

Okay.” The counselor continues, “And you keep picking your nose in public.” “Well, it’s another thing my father specifically commanded me to do! He told me to always keep my nose clean.” The counselor smiles. “That just means you should stay out of trouble. And,” he continued, “finally, she says that you never allow her to be on top during your lovemaking.” “This,” says the husband, “is the last thing my father commanded me to do on his deathbed, and it’s the most important thing.” “What did he say?” The husband replies, “With his dying breath, he said, ‘Don’t screw up.’”"}

She’s his age (51), witty, sharp-minded and was beautiful (she’s Russian after all). A stereotypical representation of an action movie antagonist but with a kind heart, she would make a great bussiness companion who will genuinely love him for who he is. “I would be happy with her for the rest of my life.

She’s not in for the money because she has plenty already.” Weeks have passed and he met a young starlete from Belgium named Chloe. She sure had all the right atributes to double his heart rate in a matter of seconds. Even though she seemed dumb and stupid, he knew that she was in for the money and that once he dies she will inherit everything he owns since he had no sons. “What the heck, why don’t I choose her? An obvious gold digger, but why do I care? I have no children and I want some fun before I get too old. I don’t need bussiness companions, I need fun!” A month later he met Margharet, an Australian hardworking housewife. She was born in the wild Australian outback and learned to fight with wild animals at a young age. “A heck of a housewife! I pay my housekeepers and maids 10.000£ a day in total and I can’t fuck them. Not only will I save money, but I also get to fuck her! Money means nothing to her, she only likes me because I go hunting and trekking often. If I get too old and boring will she leave me?” So, who did Mr. Mann choose?

Upon arrival at work and before he can say anything, he is summoned to the office of his boss. \"I'm sorry, but we have to let you go due to changed priorities. As this is not your fault, you will be compensated with a severance pay of $50,000. I'll be happy to introduce you to any future employer.

After nearly checking the whole house, it almost seems like his wife is not at home, even though the door was not locked. Suddenly he sees that the ladder to the attic is lowered.

One example that stands out was that of Sir John. A strong and noble knight who had a short temper when it came to his family name. He spent his days upholding the rules laid out for him and drinking inordinate amounts of ale. Two peasants ran up to an intoxicated Sir John and blurted “your mom’s a rocket, man!” Three seconds later, the usually steel faced knight slapped the bums across their faces. It took no longer than a few minutes for the king himself to show up with a sickle in an attempt to flex his muscles. He decreed “it shall be as such. One limb for each of the men you have dishonoured.” As the peasants pinned Sir John down at his right side. The king began to swing. Five slices, it took to remove Sir John’s appendages. Unfortunately he died of blood loss at the scene. The king was so excited to have made an example of a senior member of the military that he rode off on his horse with unprecedented haste, swinging the arm & leg around as trophies. Eight rebel knights and three of their squires decided to hold a ceremony for their departed John. A funeral for a friend. As John’s corpse was being lowered into the grave, his widow came running down from the keep, yelling for the men to stop. Thirteen strides, the fair maiden took. All in attempt to hold her beloved once more. She made it to the valley and to her husband. She lay with his dead head in her arms. Love lay bleeding in her hands. Twenty one years later, the lady Fibonacci was telling the story to her kids, on her deathbed. The legend of sir John and the mockery of the old rule. The tale of when Saturday’s Knight was made All Right for Fighting."}

None of the wood there came from the trees in the forest that they were camping in. He comes back with some wood and tells the mathematician about it. “Check this out. I found a huge pile of wood up north of our campsite not very far away. We can take just a few stumps and we will be good for campfire fuel for the rest of the time we are here.” The mathematician hesitated but the chemist ignores him and continues to take wood from the mysterious free pile. When the chemist gets back he sees the mathematician with some wood and an axe. Curious about what’s going on the chemist asks him about it. Chemist: “Where did you get that wood? Why do you have an axe with you?” Mathematician: “I used the axe to get some wood from some nearby trees.” Chemist: “You’re killing trees for no reason. Why wouldn’t you just take from the abundance of wood in the huge pile that I’ve been getting it from?” Mathematician: “Because I prefer natural logs.”"}

Let's go!\" We went to lunch. But we didn't go where we normally would go. She chose instead a quiet bistro with a private table. We had two Martinis each and I enjoyed the meal tremendously. On the way back to the office, Jane said, \"You know, It's such a beautiful day... We don't need to go straight back to the office, do we?\" I responded, \"I guess not. What do you have in mind?\" She said, \"Let's drop by my apartment, it's just around the corner.\" After arriving at her apartment, Jane turned to me and said, \"Boss, if you don't mind, I'm going to step into the bedroom for just a moment. I'll be right back.\" \"Okay,\" I nervously replied. She went into the bedroom and, after a couple of minutes, she came out carrying a huge birthday cake. Followed by my wife, my kids, and dozens of my friends and co-workers, all singing \"Happy birthday\". And I just sat there... On the couch... Sobbing... Naked... and erect."}

{"prompt": "I'm a bit cross", "completion": "The English are feeling the pinch in relation to recent virus threat and have therefore raised their threat level from “Miffed” to “Peeved.” Soon, though, level may be raised yet again to “Irritated” or even “A Bit Cross.” The English have not been “A Bit Cross” since the blitz in 1940 when tea supplies nearly ran out. The virus has been re-categorized from “Tiresome” to “A Bloody Nuisance.” The last time the British issued a “Bloody Nuisance” warning level was in 1588, when threatened by the Spanish Armada. The Scots have raised their threat level from “Pissed Off” to “Let's Get the Bastard.” They don't have any other levels. This is the reason they have been used on the front line of the British army for the last 300 years. The French government announced yesterday that it has raised its alert level from “Run” to “Hide.” The only two higher levels in France are “Collaborate” and “Surrender.” The rise was precipitated by a recent fire that destroyed France's white flag factory, effectively paralyzing the country's military capability. Italy has increased the alert level from “Shout Loudly and Excitedly” to “Elaborate Military Posturing.” Two more levels remain: “Ineffective Combat Operations” and “Change Sides.” The Germans have increased their alert state from “Disdainful Arrogance” to “Dress in Uniform and Sing Marching Songs.” They also have two higher levels: “Invade a Neighbour” and “Lose.” Belgians, on the other hand, are all on holiday as usual; the only threat they are worried about is NATO pulling out of Brussels. The Spanish are all excited to see their new submarines ready to deploy. These beautifully designed subs have glass bottoms so the new Spanish navy can get a really good look at the old Spanish navy. Australia, meanwhile, has raised its alert level from “No worries” to “She'll be alright, Mate.” Two more escalation levels remain: “Crikey! I think we'll need to cancel the barbie this weekend!” and “The barbie is cancelled.” So far, no situation has ever warranted use of the final escalation level. The Russians have said “Its not us”"}

He returns the next day with the banana and a Snickers bar. He is instructed to disrobe and bend over. The doctor then takes the banana, shoves it up the mans ass and waits 60 seconds. Then he takes the Snickers bar and shoves it up the man's ass and waits 60 seconds. \"Ok sir. Come back tomorrow at the same time with the same items.\" The next day, the man returns and the doctor repeats the same procedure. This goes on for 5 more days until the man is about to break. \"Doctor! Please! How long must we do this for?\" The Doctor apologizes for the man's discomfort but reassures him that tomorrow will be his last appointment. He said to come back at the same time but this time to bring a banana, a Snickers bar and a hammer. \"A hammer?\" says the man, shaking. \"Yes. Just trust me.\" say the Doctor. The next day the man returns with the banana, the Snickers and the hammer. The doctor asks him again to disrobe and bend over and proceeds to shove the banana up the man's ass. He waits 60 seconds.....120 seconds......3 minutes......5 minutes. \"Well doctor? Are you going to use the snickers?\" \"Just be patient.\" Says the doctor. Just then, the worm pops his head out of the man's ass and says \"Where the hell is my Snickers?\" and the doctor grabs the hammer and SMASHES HIM!"}

{"prompt": "Lizzard", "completion": "So, not mine, but my favourite. Worth a read, I promise. Lizard Birth If you' ve raised kids (or been one), and gone through the pet syndrome, including toilet flush burials for dead goldfish, the story below will have you laughing out LOUD! I had to take my son's lizard to the vet. Here's what happened: Just after dinner one night, my son came up to tell me there was \"something wrong\" with one of the two lizards he holds prisoner in his room. \"He's just lying there looking sick,\" he told me. \"I'm serious,Dad. Can you help?\" I put my best lizard-healer expression on my face and followed him into his bedroom. One of the little lizards was indeed lying on his back, looking stressed. I immediately knew what to do. \"Honey,\" I called, \"come look at the lizard!\" \"Oh, my gosh!\" my wife exclaimed. \"She's having babies.\" \"What?\" my son demanded. \"But their names are Bert and Ernie, Mom!\" I was equally outraged. \"Hey, how can that be? I thought we said we didn't want them to reproduce,\" I said accusingly to my wife. \"Well, what do you want me to do, post a sign in their cage?\" she inquired. (I think she actually said this sarcastically!) \"No, but you were supposed to get two boys!\" \"Yeah, Bert and Ernie!\" my son agreed. \"Well, it's just a little hard to tell on some guys, you know,\" she informed me. (Again with the sarcasm!) By now the rest of the family had gathered to see what was going on. I shrugged, deciding to make the best of it. \"Kids, this is going to be a wondrous experience,\" I announced. \"We're about to witness the miracle of birth.\" \"Oh, gross!\" they shrieked. We peered at the patient. After much struggling, what looked like a tiny foot would appear briefly, vanishing a scant second later. \"We don't appear to be making much progress,\" I noted. \"It's breech,\" my wife whispered, horrified. \"Do something, Dad!\" my son urged. \"Okay, okay.\" Squeamishly, I reached in and grabbed the foot when it next appeared, giving it a gentle tug. It disappeared. I tried several more times with the same results. \"Should I call 911?\" my eldest daughter wanted to know. \"Maybe they could talk us through the trauma.\" (You see a pattern here with the females in my house?) \"Let's get Ernie to the vet,\" I said grimly. We drove to the vet with my son holding the cage in his lap. \"Breathe, Ernie, breathe,\" he urged. The vet took Ernie back to the examining room and peered at the little animal through a magnifying glass. \"What do you think, Doc, a C-section?\" I suggested scientifically. \"Oh, very interesting,\" he murmured. \"Mr. and Mrs. Cameron, may I speak to you privately for a moment?\" I gulped, nodding for my son to step outside. \"Is Ernie going to be okay?\" my wife asked. \"Oh, perfectly,\" the vet assured us. \"This lizard is not in labor. In fact, that isn't EVER going to happen. . Ernie is a boy. You see, Ernie is a young male. And occasionally, as they come into maturity, like most male species, they um . . um . .. . masturbate. Just the way he did, lying on his back\" He blushed, glancing at my wife. We were silent,absorbing this. \"So, Ernie's just, just . . . excited,\" my wife offered. \"Exactly,\" the vet replied, relieved that we understood. More silence. Then my vicious, cruel wife started to giggle. And giggle. And then even laugh loudly. Tears were now running down her face. \"It's just ... that ...I'm picturing you pulling on its . . . its . . . teeny little . . ..\" She gasped for more air to bellow in laughter once more. \"That's enough,\" I warned. We thanked the vet and hurriedly bundled the lizard and our son back into the car. He was glad everything was going to be okay. \"I know Ernie's really thankful for what you did, Dad,\" he told me. \"Oh, you have NO idea,\" my wife agreed, collapsing with laughter. Two lizards: $140. One cage: $50. Trip to the vet: $30. Memory of your husband pulling on a lizard's winkie: Priceless! Moral of the story: Pay attention in biology class. Lizards lay eggs!"}

People were crowding around four and five deep to get a good look.\" \"Four and five deep?\" said Mrs. Smith, her eyes wide with amazement. \"Yes\", the photographer replied. \"And for more than three hours, too.

The salesman hands him a tiny jar of Vaseline before driving off, remarking: 'Be wary that your seat is made of 100% pure bison leather. Make sure to put vaseline on the seat, should it rain, otherwise the leather might crack.' The man thanks the salesman and rides off on his new best friend. After 300 kilometres of touring fun, his bike begins to stutter and eventually breaks down. The man finds himself in the middle of nowhere and walks to the nearest farm. The farmer, who is working outside on the land, greets him and asks if he stays for dinner, awaiting the truck who'll pick up his bike for reparation. Eagerly the man agrees. Inside he meets the farmers wife and their beautiful daughter. When he walks into the kitchen, he's astounded by the biggest pile of dirty dishes he has ever seen. 'We have one dinner rule', the farmer says. 'Whoever speaks during dinner, has to do the dishes.' Dinner is served and everyone is enjoying the meal in total silence. When desert comes, the farmers daughter takes off her top, and starts frisking the man. In about two minutes they are making love, right there on the table. Nobody utters a word. After they finish, the farmers wife gets under the table, and blows the man like he's never been blown before. Right after she climbs on his lap, and rides him like a bull. Still, nobody has said a word. When she's done, the man lights a sigarette and peeks out of the window. He notices it's started drizzling outside, and remembers his bike is out in the open. He jolts up, grabs the vaseline and bolts to the front door, only to find it locked. He sprints back into the kitchen, making wild armgestures to the farmer, pointing outside, to the door and to his tiny jar of vaseline. The farmer, white with fear, then says: 'Allright allright, I'll do the dishes!'"}

{"prompt": "My take on a shaggy dog story", "completion": "A man walks into a bar, orders a pint and sees a sign pinned up above the till - “talking cat, going cheap.” He calls the barman over and asks him what the deal with the cat is and can he have a look at it. The man shrugs, goes into the back and returns with a mangy old Tom cat. “Here you go,” says the barman, “have a chat with him yourself. He’s still for sale - five quid.” “Hello.” Says the cat. “Wow, you really can talk!” The man says. “Oh yes, buy me a pint and packet of pork scratchings and I’ll tell you all about it.” So the man buys the cat a pint and some scratchies. “It all began,” the cat begins after taking a long drink, “back in the 1860s. India, don’t you know. I was The viceroy’s pet. Went everywhere with him, watched the birth of a great nation. Marvellous really. One day I met this ancient yogi who taught me the secrets of the universe - infinite bliss, how to communicate in any language, immortality, the lot. I studied under him for weeks and weeks. Well, after that I couldn’t stay confined to the Raj for much longer and took off on an extended quest; travelled through Asia and ended up in Novograd, Russia. Beastly cold place - don’t go, take it from me. There was this tall beardy chap, Radputin or something his name was. Anyway, I convinced him it would be a grand idea to get in with the tsarina, gullible little thing but quite rich and I’d picked up a liking for caviar and bolly by then. Then I got bored again and wandered off halfway through one of their many parties.” The cat has another deep drink and looks meaningfully at his nearly empty glass. “Another one?” The man says. “Splendid! So, I left the tsars and that wild eyed Georgian fellow to get on with whatever they were doing and made my way along the Danube to Central Europe. Ended up in this coffee shop in Vienna, inhabited by the strangest types. One of them, painter he said he was but they were dreadful really, took kindly to me. I tried to encourage him by shredding his papers and shitting in his shoes but he just got angrier and angrier. One day I brought him back a half dead mouse as a treat and he just flipped, started going on about “untermensch” and “filthy mausen” infesting the land. Quite put the willies up me, so I fucked off again. Luckily Avi Lieberwitz came by just at that moment to check how Ad was doing. I heard them playing about all the way down the road. I don’t remember much of the next few years- got in with a bad crowd. I started hanging out on this airforce base and some of the yanks there sort of adopted me as a mascot. It was alright I suppose. One night I was out for a stroll when I came upon this great big wall, all grey and new. I hopped up on it to have a look and you wouldn’t believe what I saw on the other side. This whole family was there, hiding in the shadows. The man had a ladder and he placed it up against the wall and held it steady while his wife climbed up. Now I now about ladders - you’re supposed to weave in and out of the bottom rungs, making a yowling noise while it shakes and quivers. I’ve just started my routine when the man goes to kick me - I mean the nerve of him! So I hissed and spit and clawed his shins until he let go of the ladder and it fell with a crash. Then there were all these bright lights and shouting voices so I ran away before the banging started.” The man is sitting there gobsmacked at this point. “Ahem.” “Oh right.” The man gestures for the barman who pours another pint for the cat. “Go on, what happened next?” “Really old boy? Ok. So there was this greasy fellow on the airforce base, Elvis something or other. He took me in and when he eventually finished his service he took me back to Tennessee. Great place. Good music, good food, more ladies than you can shake your tail at. Anyway I developed this irritation in my anal glands which left me walking rather oddly. I’d sort of strut, shifting my weight about so as not to leak anywhere. He thought this was great fun, we spent ages together, him with his guitar, me prowling, stiff legged across the floor in time to the beat.” The cat stopped again. “I’ve got to go for a slash. Watch my stuff, yeah?” “Sure, of course!” After the cat has left he calls the barman over again. “This is the most amazing thing I’ve ever seen! What a life story! And all from a real TALKING cat!” “Mm. yeah, whatever.” The barman mutters gloomily. “What are you talking about! This is incredible! Why does no one else know about this?” The man stops and pauses briefly, thinking hard. “And why are you selling him so cheaply?” The barman gives a weary sigh and plonks the glass he is polishing down on the bar. He looks over at the man. “You wanna know why I want rid of him?” “Yes, of course!” “Because it’s all bullshit, he never did any of that stuff and the little prick never buys his round.”"}

Day 13. My mind and subconscious mind have been drinking wine for three hours and singing \"Star-Spangled Banner\". Day 15. I have no fever. So at least Chocko - my mixer - told me. Day 17. I befriended the washing machine and finally stopped crying. Now I'm just laughing .. for what I don't know too ... Day 19. The camel that I grow in my bathroom told me that it was no longer wrapped in one place, so I would walk it a little on the terrace. Day 21. Dumbledore is in my living room and peels peppers. I am helping him. We're fine. Day 23. I dreamed of Donald Trump. He told me to not go anywhere, then slapped me and became Kim Jong-Un. I woke up calm. Day 25. My seven chakras turned out to be fourteen. How did I know? I caught them in my bedroom hugging each other. Day 32. Today my washing machine, mixer and camel were offended and now no one but the cat is talking to me. Day 40. Quarantine was extended today. The good news is that the cat caught a mouse that speaks French and cooks. I'm not going to be hungry anymore. Day 44. Me and the antenna on the top of the roof have a secret connection. Basically, she goes out with the Cable, but what shall I do. Love does not ask. Day 50. The cat found out about our relationship and told the Cable. No one talks to me now. Day 98. The aliens came to Earth, but they do not let them in the country, because they do not have Visas and need to be quarantined for 120 days. Day 108. I came to enlightenment. This isolation helped me connect to space. From there, I was told that Dwayne Johnson and Madonna are KGB agents, and that Donald Trump and Kim Jong-Un are Siamese twins, but they do not know that the Lord is American. Day 110 and ... Is it night ... I ate the cat, mouse and camel. I also tried to eat the mixer, but I broke a tooth. DAY 120 and… I watched the news… I took a rope and decided to do bungee from the terrace… but… The last thing I hear after it cuts and I break my neck is how they announce that quarantine is lifting… Day 1 at the hospital. I lie in plaster, and Dumbledore brings me juices and fruit. Life is good again…"}

As the bus stopped and it was her turn to get on, she became aware that her skirt was too tight to allow her leg to come up to the height of the first step of the bus. Slightly embarrassed and with a quick smile to the bus driver, she reached behind her to unzip her skirt a little, thinking that this would give her enough slack to raise her leg. Again, she tried to make the step only to discover she still couldn't. So, a little more embarrassed, she once again reached behind her to unzip her skirt a little more. For the second time she attempted the step, and once again, much to her chagrin, she could not raise her leg. With a little smile to the driver, she again reached behind to unzip a little more and again was unable to make the step. About this time, a large Texan who was standing behind her picked her up easily by the waist and placed her gently on the step of the bus. She went ballistic and turned to the would-be Samaritan and screeched, \"How dare you touch my body! I don't even know who you are!' The Texan smiled and drawled, \"Well, ma'am, normally I would agree with you, but after you unzipped my fly three times, I kinda figured we are friends.\""}

The Lab looks up and says, 'Well, I discovered that I could talk when I was pretty young..I wanted to help the government, so I told the CIA. In no time at all they had me jetting from country to country, sitting in rooms with spies and world leaders, because no one figured a dog would be eavesdropping.' I was one of their most valuable spies for eight years running.....but the jetting around really tired me out, and I knew I wasn't getting any younger so I decided to settle down. I signed up for a job at the airport to do some undercover security, wandering near suspicious characters and listening in. I uncovered some incredible dealings and was awarded a batch of medals.' 'I got married, had a mess of puppies, and now I'm just retired.' The guy is amazed. He goes back in and asks the owner what he wants for the dog. Ten dollars,' the guy says. Ten dollars?

{"prompt": "A difficult marriage.", "completion": "A husband and wife were having marital struggles due to constant disagreements and an imbalance in responsibilities. The husband would come home from work and yell at his wife for not having dinner ready. The wife would yell at the husband for ignoring all the cleaning she's done when he tracked his muddy shoes in. They never tried to make each other happy anymore; it was just too much effort, and they were both tired. They tried counseling and therapy, and they were given many things to try. They set aside one night a week for date night, but they could never agree what to eat or what movie to watch. They made a list of chores, but could never agree who should be responsible for which chores. They tried to spend time with friends, but could never agree who's friends they would visit. Eventually the husband starting drinking. He would spend each night after work going to bars just so he wouldn't have to face going home. The wife started spending more time online chatting with strangers and fantasizing about meetups. The times they did spend together were filled with yelling and arguing. The husband starting carrying a flask with him wherever he went. He would wake up and immediately start drinking, and he wouldn't stop until he passed out at night. He could hardly remember what it felt like to be sober. The wife move from conversations online to coffee dates to motel infidelities. She never felt so alive as she did when driving to have sex with a stranger, and she never felt so worthless and dead inside as she did on the drive home. The husband and wife decided enough was enough. They would get divorced before the relationship became violent. They spent months fighting each other and arguing about who would get each little thing they owned. They brought in lawyers to fight for custody over simple things like the tennis rackets and the silverware set. They argued until the last minute before they turned in the paperwork the day before their court date. That day was just like all the others. The husband woke up, still a little drunk from the night before, and hit the bottle before speaking a word. The wife dolled herself up in the hopes she may meet a mysterious stranger at the courthouse and feel something other than sorrow. They got in the car and set out. The husband had barely pulled the car out of the driveway when the arguments started. He was drunk, but refused to let his wife drive. She hated his driving and wanted to listen to her music. It wasn't long before his anger got the best of him and he started driving erratically. He slammed on the gas and swerved around a corner. Their car smashed into a parked Honda. The airbags deployed as smoke billowed out of the engine. The car caught fire, and the husband and wife struggled to free themselves from the wreckage. The owner of the Honda arrived just in time to pull the couple from the burning car. Having been through a near death experience, the couple began to apologize for the first time in years through streaming tears and muffled sobs. The husband would stop drinking and help with the dishes. The wife would spend less time focused on herself and more time supporting her husband and the stress of his job. They were both sorry for the things they had done to each other. They decided they would work together, support each other, and try to make the relationship work. Two weeks later, the husband and wife were having lunch with their mutual friends. They were sober, honest, happy, in love, and most of all they were not arguing. Their friends noticed the clear difference in the relationship and said, \"Wow! It seems like you guys are doing so much better!\" The husband smiled at his wife and looked to their friends. He took a deep breath and said, \"Our lives are changed, and we couldn't be happier, and it's all because we finally struck an Accord.\""}

He grabbed it, stuck it up his butt, pulled it out and then ate it. Then the monkey found a peanut and again stuck it up his butt, pulled it out and ate it. The bartender asked, \"Did you see what that filthy ape just did?\" \"No, what?\" asked the man. \"Well, he stuck both a maraschino cherry and a peanut up his arse, then he pulled them out and ate them.\" \"Yeah, that doesn't surprise me,\" replied the guy. \"He'll eat anything, but ever since he had to shit out that cue ball, he measures everything first.\""}

The devil is astonished. \"Everyone down here is in abject misery, and you seem to be enjoying yourselves.\" The two Michiganders reply, \"Well, ya know, we don't get too much warm weather up there in Michigan, we've just got to have a cookout when the weather is this nice.\" The devil is absolutely furious, he can hardly see straight. Finally, he comes up with an answer. These two love the heat because they have been cold all their lives. He decides to turn all the heat in hell off. The next morning, the temperature is below zero, icicles are hanging everywhere, the people are shivering so bad, they are unable to wail, moan or gnash their teeth. The devil smiles and heads for the room with the 2 Michiganders. He finds them back in their parkas, mittens and hats. They are jumping up and down and cheering. The devil was dumbfounded. \"I don't understand. When I turn the heat up, you're happy. Now it's freezing cold, and you're happy.

Eventually, they were running so low on supplies that everyone only had the ammo on their person left. Gathering his courage, one of the guardsmen floated the idea of a tactical advance towards the home base to their commissar. \"Sir, at this rate, we will have no ammo left in an hour.\" \"Don't be ridiculous, soldier! All you need is your faith in the Emperor.\" The commissar looked at him disapprovingly, raised his pistol at a charging ork, and yanked it up while shouting BANG! To everyone's surprise, the ork fell to the ground, unmoving. Emboldened, the soldiers started imitating him as they ran out of ammo, and the orks kept falling. Eventually they were really getting into it, even tossing rocks as grenades, and the battle was soon turning in their favour. Suddenly though, the orks broke through the \"fire\" and trampled the guardsmen. Before he lost consciousness, the last thing he heard, was the orks' chanting. \"IMMA TANK IMMA TANK IMMA TANK\""}

They immediately impounded the aircraft and hauled the pilot into an interrogation room. The pilot's story was that he took off from Vegas, got lost, and spotted the Base just as he was about to run out of fuel. The Air Force started a full FBI background check on the pilot and held him overnight during the investigation. By the next day, they were finally convinced that the pilot really was lost and wasn't a spy. They gassed up his airplane, gave him a terrifying \"you-did-not-see-a-base\" briefing, complete with threats of spending the rest of his life in prison, told him Vegas was that-a-way on such and such a heading, and sent him on his way. The next day, to the total disbelief of the Air Force, the same Cessna showed up again. Once again, the MP's surrounded the plane...only this time there were two people in the plane. The same pilot jumped out and said, \"Do anything you want to me, but my wife is in the plane and you have to tell her where I was last night!\""}

'Then, I waved my finger around my head to show him that God was all around us. He responded by pointing to the ground to show that God was also right here with us.' 'Finally, I pulled out the wine and wafer to show that God absolves us of all our sins. He pulled out an apple to remind me of the original sin.'

She melts. He then takes her to a magic show and pays extra to have her involved in the main act as the woman who disappears within the act. She is beaming with joy. She's loving every minute of it as they return to their hotel. They check in and decide to go to the poker floor for some gambling before heading up to their room. They play a few hands, win a little and the husband excuses himself to go the bathroom. Unfortunately, a new, fairly naive employee is running the concierge desk and finds the woman by herself. He mentions to her that the room is now ready and that Dumbo was already delivered. Since she had no idea what he was talking about as the husband handled booking everything she just assumed it was some exciting surprise. The husband comes back and she motions it's time to head up to bed with a suggesting wink. As they get to their room, a massive sprawling suite, the husband tells her he has two more surprises for her. There is a strange smell in the suite but it's beautiful and overlooks the strip. They head out to the balcony and on ice is their favorite wine from their honeymoon. They start to loosen their clothing and really relax into the evening... it's getting quite steamy between the two. The husband says, ok I have one more surprise, wait here. Five minutes later, he calls out for her to come to the bathroom. He's set the stage as he has lit candles and a warm bubble bath poured with smooth jazz playing in the background. They begin to undress but suddenly there is a knock on the door. The husband winks at his wife. He goes to answer the door and tells her to get in the tub. The night of surprises continue as the husband walks back in with a naked man. The wife gasps and is very confused. The husband begins to tell her about some very surprising, erotic fantasies he has had about a threesome. She continues to have a very confused look on her face. Shes never had a night like this in all 15 years of her marriage. Seeing that his wife isn't into this, he asks the man to give them a second. He leans over to the tub and says, \"Is everything ok? I thought you would be into this. Maybe I read this wrong but I thought I might like it too.\" She stares at him and that loving gaze he saw earlier in the night turned into a glare. Several awkward moments of silence pass and the suspense is upsetting to the husband. He thinks to himself, \"what was i thinking...\" \"does she think I am homosexual?\" \"Am I?\" \"Did I just screw up 15 perfect years of marriage??\" \"Please say something!\" He pleads. She raises her arms in disbelief. \"Are we not going to talk about the elephant in the room?\""}

She goes to the fourth floor and the sign reads: Floor 4 - These men Have Jobs, Love Kids, are Drop-dead Good Looking and Help With Housework. \"Oh, mercy me!\" she exclaims, \"I can hardly stand it!\" Still, she goes to the fifth floor and the sign reads: Floor 5 - These men Have Jobs, Love Kids, are Drop-dead Gorgeous, Help with Housework, and Have a Strong Romantic Streak.

This floor exists solely as proof that women are impossible to please. Thank you for shopping at the Husband Store.

The food is nutritionally complete so it works well and I was going to try it again. (I have to mention here that practically everyone in queue was now enthralled with my story.) Horrified, she asked me if I ended up in intensive care because the dog food poisoned me. I told her no, I stepped off the kerb to sniff an Irish Setter's arse and a car hit me.

He has always had an extremely potent sex drive, his name is \"Busta\" (if you catch my drift). Have you ever been seduced by a parrot before? No? Well, it is hella weird and kinda perverted given the squawky voice that parrots have. The attempts are very rudimentary and sloppy as a bj from a spider monkey, but there is definitely an attempt to sound natural and sexy. His favorite phrases vary from nonsense such as \"Boy you tomato? Cuz Busta wanna hump\" to a relatively sophisticated \"Guess where I hide food pellets\" or even \"You. Me. Bang Bang!\" Now, it eventually came to the point that I could no longer simply ignore his advances. (Plus I was getting tired of being woken up to a bird dry humping my foot) Yesterday, I had a sit down with him, it played out something like this. Me: \"Yo, so umm... we gotta talk\" Busta: \"You fuck me?\" Me: \"NO! See, this is what we gotta talk about man. Listen, You are a damn sexy parrot bro, and any other bird would be lucky to have you.

The woman was amazed by its skills but she didn't like its price so much. \"5 thousand dollars are too much for what he does\" she said. Eventually the woman did not find something that she liked, so she was ready to leave. The shopkeeper aware of her displeasure, told her to wait and went to the back, only to come back with a huge black bird, full of grey spots, sharp claws, a sliced eye and a crooked beak. The woman disgusted from the monstrosity that laid upon her, asked what kind of bird that was. The shopkeeper told her everything about the bird. How it was trained by Bruce Lee himself, the art o karate, Kung fu and a bunch of others. She was amazed, but again it was not enough for her to buy it. The shopkeeper told her to be patient. He organised a little representation of what the parrot could do. He took her to the back where many random furniture were scattered all over the place. The shopkeeper started by pointing a wooden chair and saying \"chair karate\" The menacing bird raised its wings, and within a split second, the chair was cut into million pieces. He then proceeded by pointing a big iron wardrobe and saying \"wardrobe karate\" The bird again raises its wings and destroys the wardrobe. The woman shocked, pulled out her purse and took out a good amount of cash, and she gave it to the shopkeeper. She took the parrot and started heading home. When she arrived she found her husband lying on the couch watching TV. He saw the bird with surprise and curiosity and asked her wife what was that abomination that sat on her shoulder, and why did she return home without a parrot that she said she got it. She answered that this is the parrot that she choose, and she also tried to convince him that it would be great as a bodyguard. Curious the man asks why. She told him how the bird knows karate, can destroy anything and defeat any burglar. The man laughed at her claims and said: \"Pffft, karate my ass! \""}

{"prompt": "The National Park Rangers are advising hikers in Glacier National Park and other Rocky Mountain parks to be alert for bears and take extra precautions to avoid an encounter.", "completion": "They advise park visitors to wear little bells on their clothes so they make noise when hiking. The bell noise allows bears to hear them coming from a distance and not be startled by a hiker accidentally sneaking up on them. This might cause a bear to charge. Visitors should also carry a pepper spray can just in case a bear is encountered. Spraying the pepper into the air will irritate the bear's sensitive nose and it will run away. It is also a good idea to keep an eye out for fresh bear scat so you have an idea if bears are in the area. People should be able to recognize the difference between black bear and grizzly bear scat. Black bear droppings are smaller and often contain berries, leaves, and possibly bits of fur. Grizzly bear droppings tend to contain small bells and smell of pepper."}

The driver, a young man in a Brioni suit, Gucci shoes, Ray Ban sunglasses and YSL tie, leaned out the window and asked the cowboy, \"If I tell you exactly how many cows and calves you have in your herd, Will you give me a calf?\" Bud looks at the man, obviously a yuppie, then looks at his peacefully grazing herd and calmly answers, \"Sure, Why not?\" The yuppie parks his car, whips out his Dell notebook computer, connects it to his Cingular RAZR V3 cell phone, and surfs to a NASA page on the Internet, where he calls up a GPS satellite to get an exact fix on his location which he then feeds to another NASA satellite that scans the area in an ultra-high-resolution photo.. The young man then opens the digital photo in Adobe Photoshop and exports it to an image processing facility in Hamburg , Germany .. Within seconds, he receives an email on his Palm Pilot that the image has been processed and the data stored. He then accesses an MS-SQL database through an ODBC connected Excel spreadsheet with email on his Blackberry and, after a few minutes, receives a response.. Finally, he prints out a full-color, 150-page report on his hi-tech, miniaturized HP LaserJet printer, turns to the cowboy and says, \"You have exactly 1,586 cows and calves.\" \"That's right. Well, I guess you can take one of my calves,\" says Bud. He watches the young man select one of the animals and looks on with amusement as the young man stuffs it into the trunk of his car. Then Bud says to the young man, \"If I can tell you exactly what your business is, will you give me back my calf?\" The young man thinks about it for a second and then says, \"Okay, why not?\" \"You're a Congressman for the U.S. Government\", says Bud. \"Wow! That's correct,\" says the yuppie, \"but how did you guess that?\" \"No guessing required.\" answered the cowboy. \"You showed up here even though nobody called you; you want to get paid for an answer I already knew, to a question I never asked. You used millions of dollars worth of equipment trying to show me how much smarter than me you are; and you don't know a thing about how working people make a living - or about cows, for that matter.

He sets the hamster down on the bar. It scurries about, jumps off the end, turns a perfect somersault in midair, and lands on the piano.

So what you do is you do a thirty second keg stand and you then have to complete three tasks. If you complete all three tasks, then you win $5,000. It's all safe and totally legal.\" The man sees no visible reason to object, so he says, \"Sure, why not? How hard can this be?\" \"You'll see. The first thing you'll do after your keg stand is eat our famous deluxe double cheeseburger meal with every possible ingredient on the burger and an extra large fries and a shake.\" The man nods, and a smug look crosses his face. *This'll be easy,* he thought to himself. \"Next up, there's an alligator we've been trying to get rid of that's been lurking behind the bar in the back alley sewer. You'll go through that door to get there. You are allowed to use a baseball bat that's sitting by the door. Kill the alligator and deposit it in the garbage disposal.\" The man nods again, this time enthusiastically, and gestures for the bartender to continue. \"For your last challenge, you will go up the back stairs and enter the first door on the left. In that room, a prostitute is waiting for you. Have sex with her and last for ten minutes, and come back down. After all has been completed, you will walk out of here with $5,000 of cold, hard cash. Do you agree to these terms?\" \"I agree to your terms,\" the man replies. The bartender grins and exclaims, \"Great! You have exactly one hour to complete this challenge. Are you ready?\" \"Hell yes. Let's DO THIS!!\" The man rips his shirt off to reveal his muscular figure in the spirit of drunkenness. \"Okay.\" The bartender turns and shouts to everyone in the bar, \"Great news! We have a participant!!\" Cheering ensues from the rest of the bar. The bartender turns back to the man and says, \"Time starts... NOW!\" He performs the keg stand, while the entire room full of people cheer him on and count - \"TWENTY-SEVEN, TWENTY-EIGHT, TWENTY-NIIIIIINE, THIRTY!!\" The man ROARS in triumph and starts to demolish the deluxe burger combo, which he polishes off in 7 minutes and 32 seconds. The bartender shouts, \"Fifty-one minutes and thirty seconds left to go!\" The man, feeling empowered by the people at the bar, storms out the back door. Five minutes pass. Then, ten. Fifteen. Twenty. Twenty five. FINALLY, at twenty six minutes and three seconds gone by, the man re-enters the building, pants and shoes badly tattered and soaked with sewer water.

However, the sanitizing process left the stage dangerously slippery. Because of the shortage of household supplies, the maintenance team had no paper towels to wipe away the disinfectant, and they almost had to cancel the show. Luckily a stagehand had an idea. He found an old dictionary in the props closet, ripped out its pages, and laid them all down individually to cover the entire stage. This gave the actors just enough traction to safely perform. The play was steamed tó over 50,000 viewers and went off without a hitch, The next day the producer tracked the stage hand. \"I owe you a debt l of gratitude! Your idea saved the day! I've been reading reviews online and everybody is raving about how much they enjoyed the show!\" The stagehand nodded confidently and said, \"I'm not surprised.

When he got there he noticed right away that they only had male staff. Once he was seated, he asked his waiter, “Why are there only male staff?”. The waiter replied, “Well the owner did a study and apparently male staff have more energy and need to take less breaks, and well time is money.” The reporter wasn’t sure on this but maybe it was true. He went ahead and ordered some soup. While he was eating his soup he happened to drop his spoon. His waiter was nearby and immediately gave him a replacement from his breast pocket. “That was quick!” He said to the waiter. “Do you always have a spare spoon in your breast pocket?” The waiter responded “If you take a look around, all the waiters have spoons in their breast pocket. Apparently the owner did a study and spoons are the most dropped utensil. Knowing this he told us to carry one in our breast pocket so that when a customer drops one, we don’t have to take the time to go back to the kitchen to get another one and well time is money.” The reporter was starting to think wow this owner really knows his stuff because after all I did drop my spoon. He kept eating until he noticed that all the waiters also had a string tied from the breast pocket down to their pants zipper. He called over his waiter and said “So I noticed the string that goes down to your zipper. What’s up with that?”. The waiter was a little embarrassed and said “Well this one is a bit odd and embarrassing to say, but since you’re a reporter I’ll go ahead and tell you. The owner did a study and it takes men about 3 mins to go to the bathroom, wash their hands, and get back to work. He wanted to cut that time in half, so he made us tie the end of the string to the tips of our privates so when we go to the bathroom we just unzip, pull on the string and it comes out. We don’t have to touch it so we don’t have to wash our hands, which saves time and well time is money.” This caught the reporter off guard. “That is the strangest thing I’ve heard, but I suppose it makes sense.” The waiter was about to leave when the reporter said “Wait! I see how you get it out, but ummm how do you get it back in your pants?” The waiter leaned in and said “I don’t know about the rest of the guys, but I use the spoon!”"}

What's going on in that primordial brain of yours?\" He shrugged, hopped in his truck and drove off without his wife.

The virus has been re-categorized from \"Tiresome\" to \"A Bloody Nuisance.\" The last time the British issued a \"Bloody Nuisance\" warning level was in 1588, when threatened by the Spanish Armada. The Scots have raised their threat level from \"Pissed Off\" to \"Let's Get the Bastard.\" They don't have any other levels. This is the reason they have been used on the front line of the British army for the last 300 years. The French government announced yesterday that it has raised its alert level from \"Run\" to \"Hide.\" The only two higher levels in France are \"Collaborate\" and \"Surrender.\" The rise was precipitated by a recent fire that destroyed France's white flag factory, effectively paralyzing the country's military capability. Italy has increased the alert level from \"Shout Loudly and Excitedly\" to \"Elaborate Military Posturing.\" Two more levels remain: \"Ineffective Combat Operations\" and \"Change Sides.\" The Germans have increased their alert state from \"Disdainful Arrogance\" to \"Dress in Uniform and Sing Marching Songs.\" They also have two higher levels: \"Invade a Neighbour\" and \"Lose.\" Belgians, on the other hand, are all on holiday as usual; the only threat they are worried about is NATO pulling out of Brussels. The Spanish are all excited to see their new submarines ready to deploy. These beautifully designed subs have glass bottoms so the new Spanish navy can get a really good look at the old Spanish navy. Australia, meanwhile, has raised its alert level from \"No worries\" to \"She'll be alright, Mate.\" Two more escalation levels remain: \"Crikey! I think we'll need to cancel the barbie this weekend!\" and \"The barbie is cancelled.\" So far, no situation has ever warranted use of the final escalation level."}

{"prompt": "A Man and his dog are stranded on an island", "completion": "Their ship sank and only they survived. The First thing the man does is find water and a source of food. However, after some time has passed the man begins to explore the island, with his dog always by his side. He finds nothing but a goat at the other end of the island. At first, he thinks nothing of the goat, but a few years pass by and he begins to think more and more of the goat. It reaches the point where he actually begins to find the goat attractive in his mind, since he's had no intimacy with anyone and feels so starved of his sexual life. He was in need. One day he says \"fuck it\" and decides to approach the goat. He comes near it and begins to smell it, caress it and whisper sweet nothings into its ear. But his dog was not having it and immediately began barking at him loudly. The man was unaffected. He was deeply hipnotized by the goat and was already beginning to remove his clothes. In that moment the dog reacted with deep jealousy and bit his ankle. The man put his clothes back on and grabbed the dog and dragged him all the way back to the other side of the island so he could be alone with the goat. Once they were, he just went for it and put his peepee inside the goat and began to make crazy love to the goat. But the dog had made its way back and once again attacked the man disrupting his intercourse with the goat. This time the man was angry as shit and not only did he give the dog a beating but he tied him to a coconut tree with some improvised materials he found. He was still erect as a geeser and proceeded to fornicate frantically with the goat. Once again, just as the man was about to colossally ejaculate, the dog, who had freed itself, was once again barking and bitting with all its might, interrupting the sex act at the most crucial moment. In that precise moment suddenly a smoking hot nude woman washes up on the shore unconscious. The man forgets all about the fight and rescues the lady with some cpr. The woman quickly comes back to life and says \"who are you? You saved my life! I owe you. I will do anything you say, please let me repay you?! \" You'll do anything?\" says the man \" yes!!! Anything at all!!! She replies \"OK, can you just please hold my dog?\""}

{"prompt": "Quarantine", "completion": "First day of isolation: - This covid thing even has its advantages: I don't go to the office to put up with my moron boss and I can sleep until later - I will take the opportunity to read those books I bought at the book fair in 1988 when I was dating my wife and took her there - to see if I disconnect a bit from the net and the book of faces and strengthen ties with the OH and the kids. Second day of isolation: - my apartment is really cool and cozy - I have a 5 star family: my wife is sweet and the kids are cool - the neighbours are the best. Third day of isolation: - kids wake up very early - my wife snores - I really loved the breakfast she made but I didn't really understood what she meant by \"this is not a hotel\" - the neighbors are a little strange. Fourth day isolation: - the stupid kids already took two slaps each, they are two terrorists - the girl has also started to talk shit - I went to take out the trash, someone had disinfected the elevator with bleach. I pressed the buttons with the my stumps. Fifth day of isolation: - kill me - I'd rather catch the virus than to be in this hell - there's no more booz, suicide seems the best solution - the witch won't let go - I suspect the kids are not mine - the upstairs neighbours didn't give me a roll of toilet paper, scrooges. Tenth day of isolation: - alcohol and tobacco deprivation makes me hallucinate - my wife and I are much better since she barricaded herself in the bedroom - I gave the kids for adoption - the neighbors are a bunch of motherfuckes."}

Honestly, I don’t remember why we started fighting. But, for this occasion, we were playfully fighting and then I punched him a little too hard. Slowly each punch had increasing strength. We threw about twenty at each other. Then I tackled him to the ground and held him down with my fist. I usually stopped when I heard crying. My mom ran in and tried to figure out what happened. She was too late. It was over. Now I am just standing above my brother and he is crying on the ground. As the victor, I got punished. So my mom grabbed her wooden spoon from the kitchen to spank me. She made me pull down my pants and lay on her lap with my head and feet sprawling over. After the first hit, I started chuckling. So the second hit came even harder making me laugh. On the third hit, you crack. The spoon splintered in the middle. She decided to stop because she was afraid she actually hurt me. But I just laughed at her face. I did have some welts from it but my butt is so bony so it already hurts to sit on it. Now I like rough sex."}

{"prompt": "I have learned a new metric of flexibility.", "completion": "Let us set the setting. I am fourteen years old and I am in the upstairs bathroom of my parent's apartment. To give reference I just learned about masturbation. So I have been masturbating about every day for a year. Around this time you start exploring other things you can do to jack yourself off. I would switch to my left hand because it felt like someone else was touching my dick. But I quickly learned that I did like to know that I was touching my dick and having the same grip strength I had been tuning for the past year with my right hand. I got good at jerking myself off. I had to try jacking off with my left hand to start to enjoy it. But the problem was I could only enjoy my left hand or my right hand in one session. I couldn’t switch hands during a session because it didn’t feel right. But, not even that I would have to retrain each hand over several times to enjoy it again. Many times leaving me blue. But, knowing that I am the one jacking off myself I start to think about what other parts of my body I could use. So sitting buck naked on the toilet I checked if my mouth could reach my tip. Part of my dick was very easy to reach because it got a little with stretch then the rest of them. But that is not what I wanted. With a little readjustment of my body, I was able to get my mouth over the tip and get a few inches deep. I can confirm you aren’t missing much. It just feels like there is something wet in your mouth. But not sure if your mouth is wet or your dick is wet. I only tried it a few times, never enjoying it. But it gave me a benchmark of how a blow job would feel. My first girlfriend was definitely on par."}

However, on the afternoon of their 30th anniversary, curiosity got the best of her and she lifted the lid and peeked inside. In the box were 3 empty beer cans and £81,874.25 in cash. She closed the box and put it back under the bed. Now that she knew what was in the box, she was doubly curious as to why there even was such a box with such contents. That evening they were out for a special Anniversary dinner. After dinner, Ruth could no longer contain her curiosity and she confessed, saying, *“I am so sorry. For all these years I kept my promise and never looked into the box under our bed. However, today the temptation was too much and I gave in. But now I need to know why do you keep the 3 beer cans in the box?”* … Eamonn thought for a while and said, *“I guess after all these years you deserve to know the truth. Whenever I was unfaithful to you I put an empty beer can in the box under the bed to remind myself not to do it again.”* Ruth was shocked, but said, *“Hmmm, Fiona Phillips, Penny Smith and Holly Willoughby. I am very disappointed and saddened by your behaviour. However, since you are addicted to sex, I guess it does happen and I guess 3 times is not that bad considering your problem.”* Eamonn thanked her for being so understanding. They hugged and made their peace. A little while later Ruth asked *\"Eamonn, so why do you have all that money in the box?\"* Eamonn answered; *“Well, whenever the box filled up with empty cans, I took them to the recycling centre and redeemed them for cash”*"}

As the ravens mature, they will stake off on their own to find a mate, convening into groups only when large amounts of food are present-- a dead elk, for instance. We are able to attribute the reason ravens do leave these groups to being stressed out from large groups. Scientists have found that there are elevated levels of corticosterone in the stool of group living ravens compared to the stool of solo/monogamous ravens. So in short, *Corvus corax* hormones-- mostly corticosterone-- denote bemoaning a more robust aloneness, but condone courting a consort, and forming a home to call ones own."}

But the crowd's laughter turned to total silence as the man clenched his fist around the lemon and six drops fell into the glass. As the crowd cheered, the bartender paid the $1000 and asked the little man what he did for a living. Was he a lumberjack, or a weightlifter, or what? \"I work for the IRS.\""}

But the fact remains that one has been missing ever since you were here for dinner.” Several days later, Ben received a letter from his mother which read: “Dear Son, I’m not saying that you ‘do’ sleep with Allison, and I’m not saying that you ‘do not’ sleep with Allison.

In summary, the police arrested Patrick Lawrence, 22 year old white male, in a pumpkin patch 12.01 a.m. on Friday. On Monday, at the Gwinnett County (GA) courthouse, Lawrence was charged with lewd and lascivious behavior, public indecency, and public intoxication. The suspect explained that as he was passing a pumpkin patch on his way home from a drinking session when he decided to stop, 'You know how a pumpkin is soft and squishy inside, and there was no one around for miles or at least I thought there wasn't anyone around' he stated in a telephone interview. Lawrence went on to say that he pulled over to the side of the road, picked out a pumpkin that he felt was appropriate to his purpose, cut a hole in it, and proceeded to satisfy his alleged need. 'Guess I was really into it, you know?' he commented with evident embarrassment. In the process of doing the deed, Lawrence failed to notice an approaching police car and was unaware of his audience until Officer Brenda Taylor approached him. 'It was an unusual situation, that's for sure,' said Officer Taylor. 'I walked up to Lawrence and he's just banging away at this pumpkin.' Officer Taylor went on to describe what happened when she approached Lawrence . 'I said, 'Excuse me sir, but do you realize that you're having sex with a pumpkin??' He froze and was clearly very surprised that I was there, and then he looked me straight in the face and said... 'A pumpkin? Shit ... is it midnight already?'"}

Being devoutly religious people, pre-marital sex is out of the question. So, they come up with a system. The woman marries one of the men for a week, then gets a divorce and marries the other man for a week. They just go back and forth like this. This way, each of the guys get seven days full of sex every other week, and the girl gets laid whenever she wants. This situation works out great, and their three-person community is thriving. But after eight months of this, the woman gets bit by a poisonous snake and dies. The first week is really rough. The second week is even worse. The third week is just plain terrible. The fourth week is practically unbearable. So on the fifth week, >!they decide to bury the body!<"}

The Pope raised his hand and showed three fingers. The Rabbi looked back and raised one finger. Next, the Pope waved his finger around his head. The Rabbi pointed to the ground where he sat. The Pope brought out a communion wafer and a chalice of wine. The Rabbi pulled out an apple. With that, the Pope stood up and declared himself beaten and said that the Rabbi was too clever. The Jews could stay in Italy! Later the cardinals met with the Pope and asked him what had happened. The Pope said, \"First I held up three fingers to represent the Trinity. He responded by holding up a single finger to remind me there is still only one God common to both our beliefs. Then, I waved my finger around my head to show him that God was all around us. He responded by pointing to the ground to show that God was also right here with us. Finally, I pulled out the wine and wafer to show that God absolves us of all our sins. He pulled out an apple to remind me of the original sin. He bested me at every move and I could not continue!\" Meanwhile, the Jewish community gathered to ask the Rabbi how he had won. \"I don't have a clue!!!\" the Rabbi said. \"First, he told me that we had three days to get out of Italy, so I gave him the finger. Then he tells me that the whole country would be cleared of Jews, so I told him that we were staying right here.\" \"And then what?\" asked a woman. \"Who knows!!\" said the Rabbi. \"He took out his lunch, so I took out mine!\""}

She was naked. i knew there was a man in the house coz my neighbor told me. and the man was still in the house as my wife was undressed and scared. so, i started running and searching the whole house. i searched in the kid's room, kitchen, toilet, bathroom, wardrobe and dinning. i couldn't find him and i was very tired of running, so i got a heart attack. Ghost 2: IDIOT!!!! If u would have checked the refrigerator we would have been both alive by now!!! Hahahaha"}

I answered honestly \"No, this is my first time.\"So she unwrapped the package, took one out and slipped it over her thumb. She cautioned me to make sure it was on tight and secure. I apparently still looked confused. So, she looked all around the store to see if it were empty. It was empty. \"Just a minute,\" she said, and walked to the door, and locked it. Taking my hand, she led me into the back room, unbuttoned her blouse and removed it. She unhooked her bra and laid it aside. \"Do these excite you?\" She asked. Well, I was so dumb-struck that all I could do was nod my head. She then said it was time to slip the condom on. As I was slipping it on, she dropped her skirt, removed her panties and lay down on a desk. Well, come on\", she said, \"We don't have much time.\" So I climbed on her. It was so wonderful, that unfortunately, I could no longer hold back and KAPOW. I was done within a few moments. She looked at me with a bit of a frown. \"Did you put that condom on?\" She asked.

{"prompt": "The smartest and dumbest dog.", "completion": "A butcher is very busy working at the meat counter when he notices a dog in his shop. He shoos him away, but the dog returns a while later. He walks over to the dog and sees that he has a note in his mouth. He takes the note and reads it, \"Can I please have 12 sausages and a leg of lamb. The dog has money in his mouth as well.\" The butcher looks in the dog's mouth and, sure enough, there's a ten dollar bill. He takes the money, puts the sausages and lamb in a bag, and places it in the dog's mouth. The butcher is very impressed, and since it's closing time, he decides to close up shop and follow the dog. So, off he goes. The dog walks down the street and comes to a crossing. He puts the bag down, jumps up and presses the crossing button. Then he waits patiently, bag in mouth, for the lights to change. They do, and he walks across the road, with the butcher following him. The dog then comes to a bus stop and starts looking at the timetable. The butcher is in awe at this stage. The dog checks the times and sits on one of the seats to wait for the bus. A few minutes later, a bus comes along. The dog walks to the front of the bus, looks at the number, and goes back to his seat. Another bus comes. Again the dog goes and looks at the number, notices it's the right bus, and climbs on. The butcher, by now open-mouthed, follows him onto the bus. The bus travels through the town and out to the suburbs. Eventually, the dog gets up and moves to the front of the bus. Standing on his hind legs, he pushes the button to stop the bus. The dog gets off the bus, groceries still in his mouth, and the butcher still following. They proceed down the road until the dog turns up the path to a house. He walks up the path and drops the groceries on the step. He then walks back down the path, takes a big run, and throws himself -whap!- against the door. He goes back down the path, takes another run, and throws himself -whap!- against the door again. There's no answer at the door, so the dog goes back down the path, jumps up on a narrow wall, and walks along the perimeter of the garden. He gets to a window and bangs his head against it several times. He walks back, jumps off the wall, and waits at the door. The butcher watches as a big guy opens the door and starts yelling and screaming at the dog. The butcher quickly runs up and stops the guy. \"What the heck are you doing? This dog is an absolute genius. He could be on TV, for goodness sake!\" The guy glares at the butcher and says, \"Genius, my eye! This is the second time this week he has forgotten the key"}
{"prompt": "A young man is looking for a fast car.", "completion": "A hip young man goes out and buys the best car available: a 2005 Bugatti Veyron 16.4. It is the best and most expensive car in the world, and it sets him back $1.24M. He takes it out for a spin and, while doing so, stops for a red light. An old man on a moped (both looking about 90 years old) pulls up next to him. The old man looks over the sleek, shiny surface of the car and asks, \"What kind of car ya' got there, sonny?\" The young man replies \"A 2005 Bugatti Veyron 16.4. It cost $1.24M. \"That's a lot of money\" says the old man, shocked. \"Why does it cost so much? \"Because this car can do up to 320 miles an hour!\" states the cool dude proudly. The moped driver asks, \"Can I take a look inside? \"Sure,\" replies the owner. So, the old man pokes his head in the window and looks around. Leaning back on his moped, the old man says \"That's a pretty nice car, all right!\" Just then, the light changes, so the guy decides to show the old man what his car can do. He floors it, and within 30 seconds the speedometer reads 320 MPH. Suddenly, he notices a dot in his rear view mirror. It seems to be getting closer! He slows down to see what it could be and suddenly, whhhoossh! Something whips by him, going much faster! \"What on earth could be going faster than my 16.4?\" the young man asks himself. Then, ahead of him, he sees a dot coming toward him. Whoooooosh! It goes by again, heading the opposite direction! And, it almost looked like the old man on the moped! \"Couldn't be,\" thinks the guy. \"How could a moped outrun a Bugatti?\" Again, he sees a dot in his rear view mirror! Whooooosh Ka-BbblaMMM! It plows into the back of his car, demolishing the rear end. The young man jumps out, and good grief, it is the old man!!! Of course the moped and the old man are hurting for certain. He runs up to the dying old man and says, \"You're hurt bad! Is there anything I can do for you?\" The old man groans and replies \"Yes. Unhook my suspenders from your side-view mirror!\""}

As he neared the pond, he heard voices shouting and laughing with glee. As he came closer, he saw it was a bunch of young women skinny-dipping in his pond. He made the women aware of his presence and they all went to the deep end. One of the women shouted to him, \"We're not coming out until you leave!\" The old man frowned, \"I didn't come down here to watch you ladies swim naked, or make you get out of the pond naked.\" Holding the bucket up he said, \"I'm here to feed the alligator.\" Some old men can still think fast ............"}

It’s important for men of all ages to get them and know how to use them.” “Oh,” his son replies, “Who buys those?” The man, seeing his son pointing to the 3 pack tells him: “Those are for high school students.

The man says, ‘A hamburger, fries and a coke,’ and turns to the ostrich, ‘What’s yours?’ ‘I’ll have the same,’ says the ostrich. A short time later the waitress returns with the order ‘That will be $9.40 please,’ and the man reaches into his pocket and pulls out the exact change for payment. The next day, the man and the ostrich come again and the man says, ‘A hamburger, fries and a coke’ The ostrich says, ‘I’ll have the same.’ Again the man reaches into his pocket and pays with exact change. This becomes routine until the two enter again. ‘The usual?’ asks the waitress. ‘No, this is Friday night, so I will have a steak, baked potato and a salad,’ says the man. ‘Same,’ says the ostrich. Shortly the waitress brings the order and says, ‘That will be $32.62.’ Once again the man pulls the exact change out of his pocket and places it on the table. The waitress cannot hold back her curiosity any longer. ‘Excuse me, sir. How do you manage to always come up with the exact change in your pocket every time? ‘Well,’ says the man, ’several years ago I was cleaning the attic and found an old lamp. When I rubbed it, a Genie appeared and offered me two wishes. My first wish was that if I ever had to pay for anything, I would just put my hand in my pocket and the right amount of money would always be there.’ ‘That’s brilliant!’ says the waitress. Most people would ask for a million dollars or something, but you’ll always be as rich as you want for as long as you live. It’s brilliant!’ ‘That’s right. Whether it’s a gallon of milk or a Rolls Royce, the exact amount of money is always there,’ says the man. The waitress asks, ‘What’s with the ostrich?’ The man sighs, pauses and answers, ‘My second wish was for a tall chick with a big butt and long legs who agrees with everything I say.’"}

{"prompt": "Heaven or Hell", "completion": "While walking down the street one day a corrupt Senator (that may be redundant) was tragically hit by a car and died. His soul arrives in heaven and is met by St. Peter at the entrance. \"Welcome to heaven,\" says St.. Peter. \"Before you settle in, it seems there is a problem. We seldom see a high official around these parts, you see, so we're not sure what to do with you.\" \"No problem, just let me in,\" says the Senator. \"Well, I'd like to, but I have orders from the higher ups. What we'll do is have you spend one day in hell and one in heaven. Then you can choose where to spend eternity.\" \"Really? I've made up my mind. I want to be in heaven,\" says the Senator. \"I'm sorry, but we have our rules.\" And with that, St. Peter escorts him to the elevator and he goes down, down, down to hell. The doors open and he finds himself in the middle of a green golf course. In the distance is a clubhouse and standing in front of it are all his friends and other politicians who had worked with him. Everyone is very happy and in evening dress. They run to greet him, shake his hand, and reminisce about the good times they had while getting rich at the expense of the people. They played a friendly game of golf and then dine on lobster, caviar and the finest champagne. Also present is the devil, who really is a very friendly guy who is having a good time dancing and telling jokes. They are all having such a good time that before the Senator realizes it, it is time to go. Everyone gives him a hearty farewell and waves while the elevator rises. The elevator goes up, up, up and the door reopens in heaven where St. Peter is waiting for him, \"Now it's time to visit heaven.” So, 24 hours passed with the Senator joining a group of contented souls moving from cloud to cloud, playing the harp and singing. They have a good time and before he realizes it, the 24 hours have gone by and St. Peter returns. \"Well, then, you've spent a day in hell and another in heaven. Now choose your eternity.\" The Senator reflects for a minute, then he answers: \"Well, I would never have said it before, I mean heaven has been delightful, but I think I would be better off in hell.\" So St. Peter escorts him to the elevator and he goes down, down, down to hell... Now the doors of the elevator open and he's in the middle of a barren land covered with waste and garbage. He sees all his friends, dressed in rags, picking up the trash and putting it in black bags as more trash falls to the ground. The devil comes over to him and puts his arm around his shoulders. \"I don't understand,\" stammers the Senator. \"Yesterday I was here and there was a golf course and clubhouse, and we ate lobster and caviar, drank champagne, and danced and had a great time. Now there's just a wasteland full of garbage and my friends look miserable. What happened?\" The devil smiles at him and says, \"Yesterday we were campaigning, Today, you voted..\""}

This shocks the barman, he non-the-less serves their drinks & asks for payment, “that’ll be £8.89 please”, the ostrich gets his wallet out and pays for his drink, “I AIN’T PAYING FOR SH*T!” screams the cat, “alright, chill for crying out loud I’ll pay for it” the man says whilst rolling his eyes. without counting a single coin, he reaches into his pocket and straight onto the bar with a handful of change, the exact change needed to pay for his & the cat’s drink, the barman was amazed by this trick but kept it to himself. The man, the ostrich and the cat drink up and head out the door, the cat doesn’t seem thankful for his drink being paid for, like as if it’s normal. The following week, the same 3 come through the door and the barman points them out to his friends he’s chatting to, “watch this” he whispers. Like de-ja-vu, the man orders a beer, ostrich has a lemonade and slice but this time the cat wants a Bloody Mary and a pickled egg & cheese & onion McCoys crisps. “That’s £13.70 please”, the ostrich pays up, the cat side eyes the man & the man, without thought, takes the EXACT change out of his pocket to pay their drinks & snacks. The barman pulls him up on it, “ok, this happened last week, you and the ostrich are ok, the cat’s a skint a**hole and whenever you pay up you always have the exact change in your pocket, like as if you’re Houdini or sommat, what’s going on??” The man takes the barman round the corner away from the ostrich & cat to explain, “well, I came across a lamp in a cave & a genie came out and gave me 3 wishes”, “oh yeah” says the barman, “The first wish, was that for everything I buy, I will always have the exact amount of change in my pocket, so that’s why that happens”. “That’s pretty straight forward”exclaims the barman, “but what about the other 2 wishes, how about the ostrich and the cat?” “I wish for a bird with long legs and a tight p*ssy”"}

I always complimented him on the newest addition to his collection. When he died a couple of years ago, he bequeathed them to me in his will. When my grandmother handed me the bag full of them, my eyes welled with tears and I smiled thinking about my grandfather looking in the mirror and straightening his tie. Why am I telling you all of this back story? Because the last time I tried to tell this to someone and I didn't give context, they thought it was weird that I was so excited about inheriting my dead grandfather's hen tie collection."}

In order to make the transition as easy as possible, I have prepared my home office so remind me of work. * I've purchased a piece of Limburger cheese and placed it on a plate in the middle of the room to remind me of the smell of certain colleagues I'm now prevented from seeing. * I've placed a few pieces of cardbord in all window panes in order to produce a draft. * I've purchased ten portable radios and tuned them to different talk radio channels, adjusting the volume to slightly above normal conversation volume. At least one radio channel host has a loud and penetrating laughter. Half of the channels are allowed some professional content, but no more. * I've had automatic blinds installed but asked the installer to reverse the motor so the blinds go up when the sun shines through my window and down when it gets cloudy. * I found a handful of old mobile phones and installed some loud and distinctive ring tones that I found online. I've agreed with my colleagues that they call them a few times per hour, avoiding the temptation to answer them until my colleagues hang up--like in the office. * For a proper coffee experience, I brew my coffee the day before. Whenever I need a cup of coffee, I reheat the entire bottle in the microwave and pour myself a cup. * I have purchased both a cooling unit and a heating unit. They are adjusted so that the cooling unit engages at two degrees higher than the heating unit disenages. It is important for them to thus compete against each other, becaues otherwise I won't get a lifelike simulation of the HVAC system in our office. * I have replaced all of my office plants with wax plants--you know, those plants that are typically arranged in a upright torus and bark covering the soil. They require minimal maintenance, and require only some cuts and adjustments every now and then, thus being treated much like all other life in the office. * Whenever I begin working on a task, I start an egg timer so that it takes no more than 23 minutes before I get interrupted. * I've invested in an electrically adjustable desk. I realize that only few people actually make use of this feature but it sends an important message about the company's concern for the well-being of its employees. If your have no pain in your back, then everything is fine. * I remove all of my personal items, PC connections, etc. from my desk every affternoon, because although I intend to use them all the next morning, I must be reminded that I can never know where I will be placed on the next work day. * I've printed a number of US letter-sized sheets with text and accompanying stikc men (M/F, of course) that communicate how to be considerate of your employees. This is exclusively to set a proper atmosphere because just like in the office, no-one follows the recommendations. * I have installed an additional DHCP server on my home network in order to get IP address conflicts. * It will be expensive, but at least once a week I'll be hiring a construction team to perform noisy work."}

Soon however, the whales realized the sailors had jumped overboard and were swimming to the safety of shore.

While he's inside, an old hillbilly wearing an old tatter shirt with suspenders putters up to the gas station on a rickety moped, barely making it to the pump. The hillbilly parks the moped and gives the attendant 5 bucks to put in the tank. While he's waiting for the fill up, he looks over and sees the brand new, shiny red convertible Corvette sitting there. He walks up to it, running his hands over the sleek body up to the driver's side, then jumps in and starts feeling all over the plush leather, admiring the knobs and dials. He grabs the steering wheel and pretends like he's racing, yelling out car noises and yanking the wheel back and forth. The owner comes out of the gas station and sees the hillbilly in his car and freaks out. He runs over yelling \"GET THE HELL OUT OF MY CAR YOU DIRTY HILLBILLY!!\", grabs him by the suspenders, throws him out of the car, gets in and slams the door and races away. The hillbilly gets on his moped and leaves, sad that he didn't get more time in the beautiful car. An hour goes by and the Corvette is racing down the freeway, it's night now. The driver notices a single headlight in his rear view mirror getting closer, and closer, until a vehicle STREAKS by him. The driver is stunned. He looks down at the speedometer and taps on the dial, glaring at the needle touching 90mph. He rubs his eyes thinking he must be tired and continues looking down the road. Then a few minutes later, he sees the single headlight again, this time coming from the opposite direction. It gets closer, closer, then ZOOM shoots by him. The driver says to himself, \"Is that...that's the old hillbilly from the gas station. He's making fun of me! I have his brand new awesome sports car and he's going faster than me on that stupid moped??\" Then again he sees in his rear view mirror the single headlight, closer, closer, then ZOOM past him. The driver has enough and pulls off to the side of the road. The headlight comes back the other way, zooming past him going back and forth again and again and again until finally the old hillbilly on the moped, his hair and beard stuck straight back from the wind, putters to a stop in front of the Corvette. He gets off the moped gasping for breath, \"GOLLY MISTER I'M SURE GLAD YOU STOPPED, MY SUSPENDERS WERE CAUGHT IN YOUR DOOR!\""}

{"prompt": "The Cowboy", "completion": "A successful rancher died and left everything to his devoted wife. She was a very good-looking woman and determined to keep the ranch, but knew very little about ranching, so she decided to place an ad in the newspaper for a ranch hand. Two cowboys applied for the job. One was gay and the other a drunk. She thought long and hard about it, and when no one else applied she decided to hire the gay guy, figuring it would be safer to have him around the house than the drunk. He proved to be a hard worker who put in long hours every day and knew a lot about ranching. For weeks, the two of them worked, and the ranch was doing very well. Then one day, the rancher's widow said to the hired hand, 'You have done a really good job, and the ranch looks great You should go into town and kick up your heels.' The hired hand readily agreed and went into town one Saturday night. One o'clock came, however, and he didn't return. Two o'clock and no hired hand. Finally he returned around two-thirty, and upon entering the room, he found the rancher's widow sitting by the fireplace with a glass of wine, waiting for him. She quietly called him over to her.

Nevertheless, to be on the safe side, he replied to his tribe that the winter was indeed going to be cold and that the members of the village should collect firewood to be prepared. Also, being a practical leader, after several days he got an idea. He went to the phone booth, called the National Weather Service and asked, \"Is the coming winter going to be cold?\" \"It looks like this winter is going to be quite cold indeed,\" the meteorologist at the weather service responded. So the Chief went back to his people and told them to collect even more wood in order to be prepared. A week later, he called the National Weather Service again. \"Is it going to be a very cold winter?\" \"Yes,\" the man at National Weather Service again replied,\"it's definitely going to be a very cold winter.\" The Chief again went back to his people and ordered them to collect every scrap of wood they could find. Two weeks later, he called the National Weather Service again. \"Are you absolutely sure that the winter is going to be very cold?\" \"Absolutely,\" the man replied. \"It's going to be one of the coldest winters ever.\" \"How can you be so sure?\" the Chief asked.

As the man sat on his roof, a helicopter flew over and a national guardsman called over a speaker, “We’ll throw down a line and save you!” “Thank You!” the man yelled back, “But I trust in the Lord, he will save me!” As the helicopter flew away, the house collapsed and the man drowned. The man entered the Gates of Heaven and stood before the Lord. “Lord” he said, “I trusted in you to save me and you let me down! How could you do that?” The Lord looked down, smiled, shook his head and said “I sent the police, a boat and a helicopter. What more do you want?”"}

The hooker rushes to the motel and pays off her room bill to the motel owner with the $100 ..

At that moment the traveler comes down the stairs, picks up the $100 bill, states that the rooms are not satisfactory, pockets the money, and leaves town. No one produced anything. No one earned anything. However, the whole town is now out of debt and looking to the future with a lot more optimism...."}

He said to himself, \"This isn't how things should be. I swear I am going to change this.\" The next day, he escaped from his master's house, and fled to the central square of the city. His master of course called the guards to get him, and 7 was outnumbered, with literally millions and trillions surrounding him. \"EVERYONE, LISTEN TO ME,\" 7 shouted, \"FOR WHAT I AM GOING TO SAY IS THE ONLY TRUTH! \"No one should be born to be enslaved! We are all numbers, and all numbers should be equal, even odd numbers!\" The moment he said it, magic happened, because what he said was indeed true. Let N be the set of all natural numbers. E be the set of all even numbers. O be the set of all odd numbers. Then, N = E + O Therefore all numbers are equal even odd numbers.

You put $100 in and if you can complete the challenges you get all the money in the jar.” Intrigued, the man asks what the challenges are. The bartender says, “Well, first you have to eat a plate of 5 rotten eggs. Second, there is a bear in the basement that has an abscess tooth. You’ll have to pull it. And finally, there’s a 90 year old lady upstairs who has never had an orgasm. You have to give her one.” The man replies, “Honestly, I was out at the rotten eggs. Thanks though.” So the man sits down and has a drink. Then another. Then another. And before long, he’s had enough liquid courage to tell the bartender, “You know what? Screw it, I’ll go for it.” So he places his $100 in the jar and the bartender brings out the eggs.

{"prompt": "The story of the kind man who built a time machine.", "completion": "It was 2020 on a cold brisk day. Larry decided that it was in his best interest to start a Youtube channel, but he wasn’t really sure what it should be about. After great thought he decided he wanted to start a diss track channel. Remember this. It’s a very important detail. At the very same time, the nicest man you’ve ever met was building a time machine. Him and his friend were having an argument on one specific thing they called “the Fact” and he was trying to get to the bottom of if it as true or not. He couldn’t quite remember the year the fact was relevant so he set the time for 1996 went on his way. The Fact was actually just whether or not Paul, the nice man, was the first to meet his wife (then gf), or if his friend had met her first. His friend, Ted, was a sportscaster for the local hockey team. Ted was a bigger man who always wore a purple jersey (the colour of the local team, “The Rhinos”) with his old number which was 16 and gained the nickname Plumb Ted Sixteen. People would hoot it...he was basically a local celebrity along with the other announcer, Ann. The funny thing about Ann was that her nickname was “Ann announcer” like an announcer. She got it in college because some guy thought it was funny, but she just owned it. Paul’s wife currently wasn’t around because she was on a work trip for 3 months in a location with no cell/wifi anything for the foreseeable future because I need her to not be around for this story to work. Something went wrong though. Paul accidently put in the wrong date and ended up somewhere along the same time frame of when Cavemen were around. He actually met one. While he was looking for some minerals to replenish the time machine’s supply, he would struck up conversations with the caveman, cleaned his wounds and taught him some words. Once the time machine was fixed, he tested it a few more times visiting the cave man a few more times, bringing him food and water. The caveman, in his broken speech grabbed both sides of Paul’s head and said “man, kind” which warmed Paul’s heart. The man didn’t understand names but would often just refer to him as “kind man” or “man, kind” Back in the future Larry is going by “This Man” as his diss track name. Like...oh “This man” is at it again. He was vaguely friends with Ted and they were talking about Paul and how he’d been missing for a few weeks. They came up with two plans. One was to find Paul, and the other was to make a diss track about the argument “the Fact” and how Ted actually met Paul’s wife first. What Paul didn’t realize was that time travel has some...unforeseen circumstances. It actually opened a rift into Hades, Hell, whatever you want to call it. As Paul was traveling back to the future one time, he and the caveman were grabbed by the devil himself and put them in a cell. There was also one other person there. A mortician who had accidently created a portal from cremating a strange mixture of things, Holy Water, a “saint” who was actually a terrible person, and a cross that happened to be in the “saint’s” pocket. Anyways, circumstances aside, the mortician. Well, because time moves differently they were there for so long that the caveman started to think that this was there home. “Truh of Prison Hades” he started to call himself. He was learning quite a few things from the two others in the eternity they were there. Meanwhile, in the current timeline, Larry and Ted were looking for Paul. They broke into his house after him not answering and found the time machine. Well, they decided to go through and Ted somehow saw the rift as they passed through and saw Paul and the others sitting there. They snuck in, broke the lock and snuck. The rift closed and they were all stuck in the future timeline. They all argued about The Fact. Truh learned more english but still couldn’t comprehend that Hell wasn’t there home and so refer as “Truh of Cell” sometimes and “Truh of Hell” other times. “Kind man” and “man, Kind” were also two things that were around. This made Paul double down and reactivate the time machine. He brought everyone with him. Paul, Larry, Truh, the mortician, who was now a good friend, and Ted all went through to see who was right. They knew they had to go to every game that season for 1996 because nobody knew what year it was, just sometime between 1996 and 1999 According to Ted, the setup for the sportscasting was that each of them had a table, him and Ann (the other announcer) sat looking half at each other, half at the screen...like a 45 degree angle or in a booth above the rink. The time that it happened Ted grabbed for his water and spilled it all over his pants and so had to walk out to change and started a conversation with Paul’s wife just outside the door of the announcer room. Well, two years later than expected they finally see the situation start everyone goes nuts. They sprint for the alleged location. When they get there...they see it. Plumb Ted is talking to Paul’s wife in the hallway. They panic thinking they’ll be seen by past Ted and jump into a nearby closet. They gather themselves and everyone falls silent. They wait a bit and go over to the announcers room after everyone has left to hide and talk until they can open the portal to the future again. How far do you think we can throw that table? Ted asks. They all realize the best way to cooperatively throw a table is to get under it and launch it with their feet. Lay down under it and launch it out the window onto the ice. Turns out the announcer table they threw landed on Paul’s wife and she died. They get back to the future and “That Man” Larry writes a diss track about Paul, the man who killed his own wife in the past. The song was called “The Fact” in tribute to the journey they’d gone on together, but didn’t realize that the diss track would gain so much momentum and ruin Paul’s life. So Paul is left depressed, single, and with a viral diss track about him. He eventually commit suicide. Why am I telling you this. I don’t want you falling into the same situation. Just don’t let “This Man” diss track you for “The Fact” in 1998, that the undertaker, Truh, Man-kind of Hell in a Cell, and Plumb Ted Sixteen, feet-threw Ann Announcer’s table."}

So there was this guy named Lort Bumblethorn, and he was renowned for getting to 99% PP, but he got in some financial trouble, sold a house, and went back to around 95%, never reaching back to his record. Eventually, Lort settled down and had a kid, named Sort. Sort was inspired by his father and believed he could reach 100% PP. He had massive success in his career, getting to 90% power, but sadly, his father passed away, which demoralized Sort. One day, Sort was in a shop, when an old man approached him, \"Excuse me, are you Lort Bumblethorn?\" \"No,\" replied Sort, \"I'm Sort, his son. No autographs please.\" \"No, no, I was a good friend of your fathers\", he reached into his pocket and pulled out a bronze rod, \"this was what your father was using to try to get to 100% power, he gave it to me for safekeeping, it can only be used by a Bumblethorn.

I'll sell it to you for only $10.00\" \"That's a nice story, but I know you're a scammer and the 'Nu' doesn't work, get out of my presence.\" \"No,\" pleaded the old man, \"please.\" Suddenly, there was a shimmer of light behind Sort, he turned around, and there was an apparition of his father, the one, the only, Lort Bumblethorn, and he spoke out to his son. \"Sort, buy Nu, it will make your PP very big.\""}

{"prompt": "The mosquito that brings disease...", "completion": "A village elder is brought a mosquito caught from a swarm. The townsfolks fear it may bring disease. So the elder says - \"I will take this mosquito, and I will determine the aspects of the disease that it may bring.\" The elder rips up the mosquito into pieces. He places each one into a tiny square dish and says - \"every square dish represents an aspect of the mosquito. its wings represent the speed at which the disease will spread, its body represents the strength of the illness, and its head represents how difficult it is to cure.\" As he places the body parts into the square dishes, they seem to melt and take on the square shape of their containers. He then takes the dishes and says - \"now we will add them to the pot, and hoist the pot to the heavens so that the gods may tell us something about these aspects of the disease.\" So he ties a noose around a small clay pot, throws in all the square dishes and some boiling water, and raises the noose on the ceremonial pole. The pot swings for a few minutes in the breeze, and just as the people start to get impatient, the elder says - \"Hush! It is done!\" He brings down the pot, and inside it is a large seed. The elder takes the seed and says - \"Hurry! We must plant this seed, and the gods will tell us what we need to know about the mosquito you brought me.\" So they plant the seed, and it sits there in the ground doing nothing. The people are wondering why the elder is watching so intently when a green stem suddenly shoots out of the ground. \"Aha!\" The elder says. \"Time to dig it up!\" So the people do, but they have a struggle unearthing the massive root that the seed has grown into. One man asks - \"O wise one, how is it possible that the root grew so fast?\" And the elder replies - \"It signifies that the disease will spread like wildfire.\" The man then asks - \"And why, pray tell, is the root so big?\" And the elder answeres him - \"That is because the disease will be very severe.\" Then the man asks - \"And why is it so hard to chip with a trowel?\" The elder replies with an air of finality - \"That tells us that the disease will be very hard to cure.\" And, in somber silence, they keep digging. Finally, they unearth the root and the elder appraises it. He sees the shape of the root - perfectly square - and murmurs - \"Oh, dear.\" The talkative man in the crowd butts in - \"What?? What's the big problem??\" And the elder says, \"Well, this disease will infect many of you. The magnitude of a vector is always equal to the square root of the sum of the squares of its components.\" The people nod gravely. Finally, the talkative man asks, \"Okay, wise one, but you used every part of the mosquito except the legs! What are those for?\" And the wise elder answers - \"Ah, but for deterimining magnitude the legs tell you nothing if you already have the high pot and noose.\""}

The next week, he amazingly managed to get his job back as a train driver but the very same week he sped up too fast and killed 2 people this time. Again he was taken to court and again given the death penalty by electric chair. The same as before he asked for a banana for his final meal and eat it just before he was sat in the chair. The switches were flipped and the electricity was turned on but once again he amazing survived. So according to laws he had to be let go again and he somehow managed to get the same job back. However the man had not leant his lesson and he sped up to fast another time and killed 3 people. He was again taken to court and given death penalty by electric chair. When asked what he wanted for his final meal he asked for a banana but the man controlling the chair replied with, “I’ve had it with you, i’m not giving you another banana just for you to walk away again.” The ex-train driver understood and sat down in the chair for a third time. The switches were flipped another time and amazingly he survived again! The man was shocked with the train driver and asked how he did it without the banana which he replied with, “it had nothing to do with the banana, i’m just not a very good conductor.”"}

The old lady stopped and then the inspector asked her like this: \\- Listen, granny, you come by every day, with that bag behind you. What the hell are you carrying in that bag? The old lady smiled and replied: \\- It's sand! Then the inspector smiled. He thought it wasn't sand at all and told the old lady to jump off the scooter to examine the bag. The old lady did, the inspector emptied the bag and there was only sand inside. Very embarrassed, he ordered the old lady to go ahead. She mounted the scooter and walked away, with the sandbag behind. But the inspector is still wary. Maybe the old lady would spend one day with sand and the next with swag, inside that damn bag. The next day, when she passed the scooter with the bag behind her, the inspector told her to stop again. He asked what was in the bag and she replied that it was sand. The inspector examined it and it was. For a month straight the inspector intercepted the old lady and, every time, what she carried in the bag was sand. That's when the inspector got upset: \\- Look, granny, I'm a customs officer with 25 years of service. Nobody gets it out of my mind that you are a smuggler. \\- But there is only sand in the bag! - insisted the old lady. And he was about to apprehend the scooter when the inspector proposed: \\- I promise you I'll let you pass. I won't arrest you, I don't apprehend, I won't tell anyone anything, but you will tell me: what is the contraband that you are passing through here every day? \\- Do you promise not to report? asked the old lady. \"I promise.\" replied the inspector. \\- Scooters."}

He's got a good sense of humor, but deep down inside I think its annoying him. He doesn't know who's doing it, and he'll immediately take down any fake ones as soon as he notices them. So I think it's time to turn things up a notch. I'm looking for help in creating a large pool of ridiculous fake certifications to pull from, so I can always have one ready to add if I see him pull the previous one down.

{"prompt": "A politician dies...", "completion": "And ends up standing in front of the pearly gates. Saint Peter looks at him for a second, flicks through his book, and finds his name. \"So, you're a politician...\" \"Well, yes, is that a problem?\" \"Oh no, no problem. But we've recently adopted a new system for people in your line of work, and unfortunately you will have to spend a day in Hell. After that however, you're free to choose where you want to spend eternity!\" \"Wait, I have to spend a day in Hell??\" says the politician. \"Them's the rules\" Says St Peter, clicks his fingers, and WOOMPH, the guy dissapears... And awakes, curled up with his hands over his eyes, knowing he's in Hell. Cautiously, he listens for the screams, sniffs the air for brimstone, and finds... Nothing. Just the smell of, is that fabric softener? And cut grass, this can't be right? \"Open your eyes!\" says a voice. \"C'mon, wakey wakey, we've only got 24 hours!\". Nervously, he uncovers his eyes, looks around, and sees he's in a hotel room. A nice one too. Wait, this is a penthouse suite... And there's a smiling man in a suit, holding a martini. \"Who are you??\" The politician asks. \"Well, I'm Satan!\" says the man, handing him the drink and helping him to his feet. \"Welcome to Hell!\" \"Wait, this is Hell? But... Where's all the pain and suffering?\" he asks. Satan throws him a wink. \"Oh, we've been a bit mis-represented over the years, it's a long story. Anyway, this is your room! The minibar is of course free, as is the room service, there's extra towels next to the hot-tub, and if you need anything, just call reception. But enough of this! It's a beautiful day, and if you'd care to look outside...\" Slightly stunned by the opulent surroundings, the man wanders over to the floor-to-ceiling windows through which the sun is glowing, looks far down, and sees a group of people cheering and waving at him from a golf course. \"It's one of 5 pro-level courses on site, and there's another 6 just a few minutes drive out past the beach and harbour!\" says Satan, answering his unasked question. So they head down in the lift, walk out through the glittering lobby where everyone waves and welcomes the man, as Satan signs autographs and cherrily talks shop with the laughing staff. And as he walks out, he sees the group on the golf course are made up of every one of his old friends, people he's admired for years but never met or worked with, and people whose work he's admired but died long before his career started. And out of the middle of this group walks his wife, with a massive smile and the body she had when she was 20, who throws her arms around him and plants a delicate kiss on his cheek. Everyone cheers and applauds, and as they slap him on the back and trade jokes, his worst enemy arrives, as a 2 foot tall goblin-esque caddy. He spends the day in the bright sunshine on the course, having the time of his life laughing at jokes and carrying important discussions, putting the world to rights with his friends while holding his delighted wife next to him as she gazes lovingly at him. Later, they return to the hotel for dinner and have an enormous meal, perfectly cooked, which descends into a food-fight when someone accidentally throws a bread roll at the next table (where Ghandi is having a game of truth-or-dare with Marylin Monroe). As everyone is falling about laughing and flinging breadsticks at each other, his wife whispers in his ear... And they return to their penthouse suite, and spend the rest of the night making love like they did on their honeymoon. After 6 hours of intense passion, the man falls deep into the 100% Egyptian cotton pillows, and falls into a deep and happy sleep... And is woken up by St Peter. \"So, that was Hell. Wasn't what you were expecting, I bet?\" \"No sir!\" says the man. \"So then\" says St Peter \"you can make your choice. It's Hell, which you saw, or Heaven, which has choral singing, talking to God, white robes, and so on\". \"Well... I know this sounds strange, but on balance, I think I'd prefer Hell\" says the politician. \"Not a problem, we totally understand! Enjoy!\" Says St Peter, and clicks his fingers again. The man wakes up in total darkness, the stench of ammonia filling the air and distant screams the only noise. As he adjusts, he can see the only light is from belches of flame far away, illuminating the ragged remains of people being tortured or burning in a sulphurous ocean. A sudden bolt of lightning reveals Satan next to him, wearing the same suit as before and grinning, holding a soldering iron in one hand and a coil of razor-wire in the other. \"What's this??\" He cries. \"Where's the hotel?? Where's my wife??? Where's the minibar, the golf-courses, the pool, the restaurant, the free drinks and the sunshine???\" \"Ah\", says Satan. \"You see, yesterday, we were campaigning. But today, you voted...\""}

The price is still $10,000.\" Again, the man pulled out the money, gave it to Valerie, and they went upstairs. After an hour, he left. The following night the man was there yet again. Everyone was astounded that he had come for a third consecutive night, but he paid Valerie and they went upstairs. After their session, Valerie said to the man, \"No one has ever been with me three nights in a row.

{"prompt": "A man with a lisp went on a blind date to a heavy metal concert", "completion": "Paul had been ridiculed all his life for having a lisp. As a kid, he was bullied in school. As an adult, he caught coworkers making fun of him when they thought he couldn't hear. He would even notice cashiers trying to stifle their laughter. No woman would ever go out with him, and he felt resigned to a life of solitude, all due to his minor speech impediment. Jolene was fat. She always had been, and nobody would let her forget it. Acquaintances, close friends, even family members: she had lost many relationships after learning what people were saying about her. One thing she always had, though, was music. Jolene *loved* heavy metal. The deafening, inescapable rage soothed her nerves whenever life got too hard, but it could never soothe her loneliness. One particularly rough day, Paul's gloominess suddenly turned to shock when he received a notification from Tinder- *he had a match!* \"Thurely this mutht be a mithtake,\" he said to himself. After too many heartbreaking experiences with first dates, he had decided to mention his lisp in his bio, and with his average looks, nobody had liked his profile since. Although he had already dismissed all hopes in his head, he still decided to check the match, both out of curiosity and to clear the notification. When he opened the app, he found that the woman in the profile was *beautiful*! He couldn't believe someone like her could have read about his lisp and still swiped right. At first he thought she may have just skipped the bio, but he knew that no woman so pretty would have liked him based on his pictures alone. He *had* to know what was going on here. It may have seemed heavy-handed, even to him, but he sent the woman a message that said, \"hey idk if u read my bio, but just so u know, i have a lisp.\" He didn't expect to hear from her again, but he had to get that out of the way. To his absolute *shock*, however, he received a notification from Tinder only 2 minutes later. \"i saw that in ur bio :)\", it said. Paul couldn't believe it. She knew about his lisp, and she had still liked him! The two of them got to talking, and before long, they had arranged to meet! That Saturday evening, Paul pulled up in front of the town event center and waited outside. As he was glancing at his phone, he heard a voice. \"Hey, are you Paul?\" He most certainly *was* Paul! He looked up to meet the voice, and- ... That was strange. Why was this random, rather large, lady asking him his name? And then it hit him... \"Oh! Are you Jolene?\" \"Yeah,\" she said. Paul had to say something, but he didn't want to be rude. \"You look a lot different than your picthure.\" \"Oh yeaaahhh...\" she said. \"That's my sister's picture. I should probably take that down.\" Paul was understandably annoyed that his date had used a fake picture to lure him in, but in all honesty, he didn't mind her size. He of all people knew what it was like to be judged and ridiculed by people who didn't appreciate him for his personality. He dropped the subject and suggested they go inside to enjoy the concert. Both of them were excited to be on the date, but each had something bugging them. Paul had agreed to see Disturbed, but in truth- he hated heavy metal. He didn't even consider it music. On the other hand, Jolene was absolutely thrilled to be doing something she loved with a date! However, her prior interaction with Paul had left her thinking he was disappointed with the way she looked. She thought he could never truly love her, and when she smiled at him, and in return, received a happy expression that looked more forced than anything, she took it as a sign. About half-way through the concert, she ran off. Paul immediately ran after her, and he found her sobbing outside the front door. \"Hey, what'th wrong?\" he asked. \"I can tell you're not having fun,\" she cried. \"It's okay. Everyone else always feels the same way.\" Paul had no idea she was talking about her weight. He just thought she had figured out that he didn't share her taste in music- definitely nothing to cry over! Laughing, he bent down to comfort her: \"Hey, if you can ackthept this terrible lithp, I'm thure I can try to get down with the thickness.\""}

They ask him questions about his survival, eagerly hearing how this man bested the wild for all these years.

That made sense. \"What is that middle hut used for?\" he followed up. \"That is my church, where I go to pray, read Scripture, and worship God, Who has kept me alive for all these years,\" answered the devout Calvinist. That also made sense. But what could the last hut be for? \"What is the rightmost hut used for?\" asked the crew member. The Calvinist answered, \"Oh, that's where I used to go to church.\""}

Go ahead.” Grandpa says, “I’ll bet you a thousand dollars that I can bite my own eye.” The auditor thinks a moment and says, “It’s a bet.” Grandpa removes his glass eye and bites it. The auditor’s jaw drops. Grandpa says, “Now, I’ll bet you two thousand dollars that I can bite my other eye.” The auditor can tell Grandpa isn’t blind, so he takes the bet. Grandpa removes his dentures and bites his good eye. The stunned auditor now realizes he has wagered and lost three grand, with Grandpa’s attorney as a witness. He starts to get nervous. “Want to go double or nothing?” Grandpa asks. “I’ll bet you six thousand dollars that I can stand on one side of your desk, and pee into that wastebasket on the other side, and never get a drop anywhere in between.” The auditor, twice burned, is cautious now, but he looks carefully and decides there’s no way this old guy could possibly manage that stunt, so he agrees again. Grandpa stands beside the desk and unzips his pants, but although he strains mightily, he can’t make the stream reach the wastebasket on the other side, so he pretty much urinates all over the auditor’s desk. The auditor leaps with joy, realizing that he has just turned a major loss into a huge win. But Grandpa’s attorney moans and puts his head in his hands. “Are you OK?” the auditor asks. “Not really,” says the attorney. “This morning, when Grandpa told me he’d been summoned for an audit, he bet me twenty-five thousand dollars that he could come in here and pee all over your desk and that you’d be happy about it.”"}

Once in a while, I’d like to be in control!” “Ah,” says the counselor, “I think I’ll talk to your husband now.” So the wife goes out of the room and the husband says to the counselor, “For years I’ve been loving and considerate and I’ve always given her what she wants! What could be the problem?” The counselor explains, “She says you’ve got these habits that are driving her crazy. First, you’re always acting strange in public—looking at the floor and never going near anyone else.” The husband looks concerned, “Oh, you don’t understand! It’s one of the few things my father told me to do on his deathbed and I swore I’d obey everything he said.” “What did he say?” “He said that I should never step on anyone’s toes!” The counselor looks amused, “Actually, that means that you should not do anything that would cause anyone else to get angry.” The husband looks sheepish, “Oh. Okay.” The counselor continues, “And you keep picking your nose in public.” “Well, it’s another thing my father specifically commanded me to do! He told me to always keep my nose clean.” The counselor smiles. “That just means you should stay out of trouble. And,” he continued, “finally, she says that you never allow her to be on top during your lovemaking.” “This,” says the husband, “is the last thing my father commanded me to do on his deathbed, and it’s the most important thing.” “What did he say?” The husband replies, “With his dying breath, he said, ‘Don’t screw up.’”"}

After driving for a few hours, they got caught in a terrible blizzard. So they pulled into a nearby farm and asked the attractive lady who answered the door if they could spend the night. 'I realize it's terrible weather out there and I have this huge house all to myself, but I'm recently widowed,' she explained. 'I'm afraid the neighbors will talk if I let you stay in my house.' 'Don't worry,' John said. 'We'll be happy to sleep in the barn. And if the weather breaks, we'll be gone at first light.' The lady agreed, and the two men found their way to the barn and settled in for the night. Come morning, the weather had cleared, and they got on their way. They enjoyed a great weekend of skiing. But about nine months later, John got an unexpected letter from an attorney. It took him a few minutes to figure it out, but he finally determined that it was from the attorney of that attractive widow he had met on the ski weekend. He dropped in on his friend Keith and asked, 'Keith, do you remember that good-looking widow from the farm we stayed at on our ski holiday up north about 9 months ago?' 'Yes, I do.' Said Keith. 'Did you, er, happen to get up in the middle of the night, go up to the house and pay her a visit?' 'Well, um, yes!,' Keith said, a little embarrassed about being found out,'I have to admit that I did.' 'And did you happen to give her my name instead of telling her your name?' Keith's face turned beet red and he said, 'Yeah, look, I'm sorry, buddy. I'm afraid I did.' 'Why do you ask?' She just died and left me everything.' (And you thought the ending would be different!)"}

When the waiter came back to serve our soup I asked, \"Why the spoon?\" \"Well, \"he explained, \"the restaurant’s owners hired Andersen Consulting to revamp all our processes. After several months of analysis, they concluded that the spoon was the most frequently dropped piece of cutlery. It represents a drop frequency of approximately 3 spoons per table per hour. If our staff are better prepared, we can reduce the number of trips back to the kitchen and save 15 man-hours per shift.\" As luck would have it, I dropped my spoon and he was able to replace it with his spare. \"I’ll get another spoon next time I go to the kitchen instead of making an extra trip to get it right now.\" I was impressed. I also noticed that there was a string hanging out of the waiter’s zip on his trousers. Looking around, I noticed that all the waiters had the same string hanging from their flies. So before he walked off, I asked the waiter, \"Excuse me, but can you tell me why you have that string right there?\" \"Oh, certainly!\" Then he lowered his voice. \"Not everyone is so observant. That consulting firm I mentioned also found out that we can save time in the rest-room. By tying this string to the tip of you know what, we can pull it out without touching it and eliminate the need to wash our hands, shortening the time spent in the rest-room by 76.39 per cent.\" I asked \"After you get it out, how do you put it back?\" \"Well,\" he whispered, \"I don’t know about the others, but I use the spoon.\""}

A police officer sitting in the next booth heard their conversation and, having a chuckle to himself, he thinks to himself, I've got to see these two old-timers having sex against a fence. I'll just keep an eye on them so there's no trouble. So he follows them. The elderly couple walks haltingly along, leaning on each other for support aided by walking sticks.. Finally, they get to the back of the tavern and make their way to the fence.. The old lady lifts her skirt and the old man drops his trousers. As she leans against the fence, the old man moves in.. Then suddenly they erupt into the most furious sex that the policeman has ever seen. This goes on for about ten minutes while both are making loud noises and moaning and screaming. Finally, they both collapse, panting on the ground.The policeman is amazed. He thinks he has learned something about life and old age that he didn't know. After about half an hour of lying on the ground recovering, the old couple struggles to their feet and puts their clothes back on.

Driving a train had been his dream ever since he was a child. He loved to make the train go as fast as possible. Unfortunately, one day he was a little too reckless and caused a crash. He made it out, but a single person died. Well, needless to say, he went to court over this incident. He was found guilty, and was sentenced to death by electrocution. When the day of the execution came, he requested a single banana as his last meal. After eating the banana, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was flown, sparks flew, and smoke filled the air - but nothing happened. The man was perfectly fine. Well, at the time, there was an old Bulgarian law that said a failed execution was a sign of divine intervention, so the man was allowed to go free. Somehow, he managed to get his old job back driving the train. Having not learned his lesson at all, he went right back to driving the train with reckless abandon. Once again, he caused a train to crash, this time killing two people. The trial went much the same as the first, resulting in a sentence of execution. For his final meal, the man requested two bananas. After eating the bananas, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was thrown, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was once again unharmed. Well, this of course meant that he was free to go. And once again, he somehow managed to get his old job back. To what should have been the surprise of no one, he crashed yet another train and killed three people. And so he once again found himself being sentenced to death. On the day of his execution, he requested his final meal: three bananas. \"You know what? No,\" said the executioner. \"I've had it with you and your stupid bananas and walking out of here unharmed. I'm not giving you a thing to eat; we're strapping you in and doing this now.\" Well, it was against protocol, but the man was strapped in to the electric chair without a last meal. The switch was pulled, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was still unharmed. The executioner was speechless. The man looked at the executioner and said, \"Oh, the bananas had nothing to do with it. I'm just a bad conductor.\""}

At lunchtime in the canteen the man, his friend, the supervisor, the other couple of coworkers and two office visitors all tried the cheese but still no definitive answer.

As luck would have it there was a piece left in the multipack. The mathematician took one look at the multicoloured cheese and declared he knew exactly what it was. It was fibona cheese."}

He tells the drunk \"I will tell you my secret but you HAVE to promise that if I tell you and you try it for yourself, then you HAVE to do exactly as I say and you will succeed\". The drunk agrees. The guy looks around and leans in and says \"My plan is bulletproof. I use a very complex play on words. Semantics are the key to my success in shagging babes. When I see a single lady, I make my move. Now this is where you have to pay attention and do just what I say. I go up to her from behind and whisper this question in her ear \"Tickle your ass with a feather?\". If she turns to me with a smile and a gleam in her eye, then I have succeeded and she knows what I want and I know what she wants and we leave to shag. Simple. The drunk snorts in disbelief and says \"Well what if she's pished off and turns to smack you which would very likely happen to me\". The guy tells the drunk \"That is what I was telling you about. If the lady is offended and exclaims \"WHAT did you say to me?!?!\" I simply point outside to the clouds and say \" I said PARTICULARLY NASTY WEATHER\" and the lady surmises that she heard me wrong and goes about her way. No harm no foul and I move on to the next. The drunk is shocked at how easy this failsafe plan is and immediately looks around for a test subject. He spots a single babe and starts to head towards her. The guy catches the drunks arm and reminds him of the importance of semantics and the drunk shrugs him off and says \"I got it\". He confidently staggers to the dark haired beauty. He leans in to her unsteadily and whispers with his whiskey breath into her ear \"Tickle your ass with a feather?\".

The bar tender is curious why all three of them are so sad. So he says \"the drinks are on the house tonight if you tell me what happened.\" The OBGYN doctor who is still wearing her blood-stained srcubs says, \"Okay fine, I'll go first.\" She proceeds to say how one of her patients was pregnant with twins and it was an incredibly difficult pregnancy, the mom was in labor for over 19 hours. She ended up bleeding to death in the middle of labor because the sutures they use to stop the bleeding were expired. Then we ran out of our usual gloves, so I was using some cheap rubber gloves the first twin slipped out of my hands onto the floor, and ended up with permanent brain damage. Almost on the verge of tears, she says that the other twin became septic from an expired IV and died. Mortified, the bar tender says \"I am so sorry\" as he pours her another drink. Thinking the stories can't get much worse, he looks at the Pizza Hut driver and asks \"what happened with you?\" Still showing multiple burn marks on his Pizza Hut uniform, he begins to tell the story of how he got a call for an order of 12 large pepperoni pizzas. \"Right when I drove by the house, I saw it was for a birthday party, with lots of kids in the back yard. Since all the parking spots were filled with all the cars of the parents, I had to park up the street on a hill. The issue was my emergency parking break, it had been broken for a few days and I planned on getting it fixed. But I was in such a hurry I thought I could just park on the hill next to the house at an angle, so my car wouldn't roll off. I thought wrong, as soon as I rang the doorbell, the car slipped out of gear and rolled down the hill. It collided with the propane tank in the back yard, igniting it, causing a massive explosion that killed 6 kids at the birthday party and left the rest hospitalized.\" Visibly sweating, the bar tender says \"Jesus Christ, I can't imagine how you feel right now, I am so sorry. Here have another drink.\" His voice now trembling, the bartender looks at the postal worker, and asks \"your story can't possibly top these two.\" Letting out a deep sigh, the postal worker says \"I was driving my usual route, and I had to drop off two packages.\" \"I was feeling tired, and even though I was running late, I figured I could just stop by Starbucks and get some coffee to help me wake up. Anyway, I spilled the coffee on myself and had to go home to change clothes, so I never had enough time to drop off those two packages.\" \"What were the packages?\" asked the bartender. Looking at the OBGYN doctor, he says \"I was supposed to drop off the first package off at your hospital, it was for the OBGYN department and the package was marked as **medical supplies: sutures, gloves, and IVs**.\" The doctor's jaw dropped. \"The second package was from Autozone and was marked **emergency hand brake replacement**\" and it was addressed to a Pizza Hut down the street. The Pizza Hut driver is turning red with rage. Realizing that the postal worker's laziness is responsible for the deaths of several women and children. He jumps over the bar in a rage. The OBGYN doctor, the Pizza Hut driver, and the bartender all surround the postal worker and tie him to a wooden post in the bar. They proceed to form a single-file line and, one-by-one, take turns just beating the shit out of the postal worker with their fists. Although the OBGYN doctor, the Pizza Hut driver, and postal worker allowed the end of this this joke to have a punchline, they messed up the delivery."}

So, the man holds out his hand and opens his palm, saying, “These are the keys to my car, which is sitting out front.” “Here are the documents, as well,” he says as he hands over a tiny stack of papers. The loan officer peeks out the window and sees a brand new Ferrari parallel parked directly in front of the bank. “One moment, please.” The loan officer walks into a back office to consult with the president of the bank. Everything checks out. So, after sharing a laugh with the president at this man leaving a $750,000 car as security for a $5,000 loan, the loan officer returns and tells the man that they will happily accept the Ferrari. An employee of the bank then drives the car into the bank’s underground garage and parks it. Two weeks later, the man returns and pays the $5,000 plus interest, which comes to $15.41. The loan officer smiles and says, “Sir, we are very happy to have your business. This transaction has worked out very nicely.” Then he adds, “But to be honest, we are a little bit puzzled.” “While you were away, we checked you out and found out that you are a multi-millionaire. So what puzzled us is why you’d bother to borrow $5,000?” The man replies, “Where else in Manhattan can I park my car for two weeks for just $15.41 and expect it to be there when I return?”"}

He threw a hand-grenade straight into a 15th story window 100 yards away. KABOOM! He threw another hand-grenade 75 yards away, right into a chimney. KA-BLOOEY! Then he threw another at a passing car going 90 mph. BULLS-EYE! \"I've got to get this guy!\" Coach said to himself. \"He has the perfect arm!\" So, he brings him to the States and teaches him the great game of football. And the Bears go on to win the Super Bowl. The young Afghan is hailed as the great hero of football, and when the coach asks him what he wants, all the young man wants is to call his mother. \"Mom,\" he says into the phone, \"I just won the Super Bowl!\" \"I don't want to talk to you\", the old Muslim woman says.\"You are not my son!\" \"I don't think you understand, Mother,\" the young man pleads. \"I've won the greatest sporting event in the world.

Now, as a point of interest, all of Boudreaux's neighbors were Catholic and as such were forbidden to eat meat on Fridays. The delicious aroma from the grilled venison steaks was causing such a problem for the Catholic faithful that they finally talked to their priest. The priest came to visit Boudreaux and suggested that Boudreaux convert to Catholicism. Boudreaux agreed. After several classes and much study, Boudreaux attended Mass to be confirmed. As the priest sprinkled holy water over Boudreaux he said, \"You were born a Baptist and raised a Baptist, but now you are a Catholic.\" Boudreaux's neighbors were greatly relieved until the next Friday night arrived and the wonderful aroma of grilled venison again filled the air. The priest was called by some of his angry parishioners and told of Boudreaux'’s actions . The priest assured the callers that he would be there immediately. When he got there he rushed into Boudreaux's yard clutching a rosary. He was prepared to scold Boudreaux for what he was doing but what he saw and heard made him stop in amazement. There at the grill stood Boudreaux. He was clutching a small bottle of water, which he carefully sprinkled over the sizzling meat as he chanted: \"You wuz born a deer, and you wuz raised a deer, but now you are a catfish.\""}

The auditor said, “Well, sir, you have an extravagant lifestyle and no full-time employment, which you explain by saying that you win money gambling. I’m not sure the IRS finds that believable.” “I’m a great gambler, and I can prove it,” says Grandpa. “How about a demonstration?” The auditor thinks for a moment and says, “OK. Go ahead.” Grandpa says, “I’ll bet you a thousand dollars that I can bite my own eye.” The auditor thinks a moment and says, “It’s a bet.” Grandpa removes his glass eye and bites it. The auditor’s jaw drops. Grandpa says, “Now, I’ll bet you two thousand dollars that I can bite my other eye.” The auditor can tell Grandpa isn’t blind, so he takes the bet. Grandpa removes his dentures and bites his good eye. The stunned auditor now realizes he has wagered and lost three grand, with Grandpa’s attorney as a witness. He starts to get nervous. “Want to go double or nothing?” Grandpa asks. “I’ll bet you six thousand dollars that I can stand on one side of your desk, and pee into that wastebasket on the other side, and never get a drop anywhere in between.” The auditor, twice burned, is cautious now, but he looks carefully and decides there’s no way this old guy could possibly manage that stunt, so he agrees again. Grandpa stands beside the desk and unzips his pants, but although he strains mightily, he can’t make the stream reach the wastebasket on the other side, so he pretty much urinates all over the auditor’s desk. The auditor leaps with joy, realizing that he has just turned a major loss into a huge win. But Grandpa’s attorney moans and puts his head in his hands. “Are you OK?” the auditor asks. “Not really,” says the attorney. “This morning, when Grandpa told me he’d been summoned for an audit, he bet me twenty-five thousand dollars that he could come in here and pee all over your desk and that you’d be happy about it.”"}

The genie disappears back into his lamp. Simultaneously awestruck and pissed off, he rubs the lamp again to no avail.

But i really love cold potatoes!” So Little john goes to the table, finds himself a chair and he waits politely untill the whole family is seated before he starts eating. Everybody is at the table and little John starts shoving those cold potatoes inside his mouth! “Nom nom nom grafmlskbvjsll”! When suddenly there falls a cold potato on the ground... Oh No! And He told his mom he would eat all the cold potatoes... so he slides his chair behind him and crawls underneath the table to find his cold potato... But just before he grabs the cold potato... he sees... between the legs of his aunt... a little hamster. And he thinks to himself ‘I have to give this cold potato to that little hamster’! So he goes with the cold potato inbetween the legs of his aunt and just an inch away from that little hamster, the little hamster goes “Ppppppprrrttttttttttt” And Little John says “you don’t have to blow on them, they are cold potatoes!” (Sorry if i made any typo’s or grammer faults- belgian guy sharing a joke)"}

{"prompt": "There was once a man named John, a master tailor.", "completion": "There was once a master tailor named John. John was never someone to start a fight, raise his hand in the classroom, or ask a person to the ballroom dance. Over all that, he preferred to stay in his workshop, creating clothes and sharing creations with the world. One day, John was given a particularly difficult job from a new client, one of a particurally high status in the city, and he wanted a piece of clothing with a *personality*. John had never heard such a request, and was beginning to take it literally. Since he was a reasonable, well thinking common man, John thought the client was fucking insane - still, nonetheless, the pay was too good to pass up. The only other thing the client said, after signing the appropriate papers and shaking the appropriate hands, was that he would be back in three days, at the last hour John was open. John was stuck on this problem for quite awhile, he had other small things on his schedule but he was consumed by this request. He thought for quite awhile, took a walk through the streets and alleyways around his workshop, and returned inspired and aroused to the adventure. He worked from twelve to twelve, up high and down low, his hands were moving faster than they had ever moved before. His eyes were red, his legs were shaking, and after a long build up in the twilight of the night, he finished. He wiped the sweat from his brow, and paced around the workshop to clean up the mess. The coat he made was white and gleaming. It reflected all the light in the room, it drew the eyes of animals outside the windows, it drew the eyes of angels, shedding a single tear for it’s beauty impounded on the world, sinking it's precense like a diagram of space-time. John was well aware of all of this, and for the time being, put it up on a coat hanger to be displayed from the front window. It wasn’t perfectly displayed, but it would do for the night. While tending to all of the last affairs of the now early morning, illuminated by candle light, John heard a loud thump behind him - \\***thump**\\* - it made him jump. He swung his head back like a tetherball, *was someone breaking in to steal the coat?* No, alas, his fears were unfounded. The coat had simply falled down, most likely due to the hastiness of setting up the display. John put the coat hanger back in its place and returned to his duties. He had picked up a broom and was sweeping up the loose threads he had left when he, again, heard another thump, louder than before - **\\*THuMP.\\*** After working for so long, the disturbance made John begin to become agitated, something that didn’t happen often. He put the coat back up for what had now been the third time. John tipped the coat hanger back up, having it wobble side to side on it's way there. John turned his head in jest, half joking to himself - thinking it would fall over the moment it left his gaze. Sure enough, the second his eyes left the coat, he heard the quickest and sharpest thump yet - ***\\*THUMP\\**** Not much can break a man like John, but after over a dozen hours of tireless work, this was the last straw. He held his anger back in fear of disturbing the neighborhood, or at this rate, the city. John’s arm gave out from clenching it so hard before he could muster a word, the tailoring had made a mark on him, clearly, and he calmed himself down. After doing so, he began to *talk* to the coat - “...You’re pretty annoying, do you think this is funny?” The air was dead, his candle brushed the room with a frail light and smoke, then the air was cracked by a shrill call, a voice calling back to him, “YoU’Re PrEtTy AnNoYiNg.” John sputtered, confused “Wha-What?” *The coat was talking back to him*! Now he was sure he was the one who was insane. But his confusion soon turned to tirelessness. The Coat continued to bicker, speak, and talk back to itself. It asked questions with no answers, and answers with no questions. It didn’t move, but it’s voice bounced around the room. It yelped some, and squealed the rest. It became clear to John that it was an annoying fucking coat. John refused to listen to the coat ramble on, and decided to get rid of it, despire the risks. He artistically titled the coat “Goodbye Annoying Coat,” and made rid of it in the alleyway near his backdoor, hoping it would keep the raccoons company, or scare them off. He returned along with the sun to start again, day 2. Again, John worked like he had never worked before, but now on something smaller. His body moved from side to side, to and fro, he moved at such a ferocity his feet swept the floor for him. His fingers flexed, dipped, dived. His needle thrust back and forth, in an unwavering pattern. At this point, life was being concieved from John's own hands. This quest consumed his entire work day, but this didn't seem to phase John. However, despite that, he was now on attempt number two for one single client, and what did he have to show for it? A red, wool hat. The hat was striking. It pulled the attention of everything in the room. It beckoned you to look at it like a prisoner in an orange jumpsuit, a car crash on the side of the road, it intimidated anyone looking for a fight. The red wool John had used certainly had paid off. John was expecting the hat to talk this time, so he started the conversation with a simple pleasantry. “Hello. How was your day?” Nothing, not as much as a peep. John repeated the question, “How was your day?” The hat stood still - then, suddenly John heard a small chirp rise from the table, it sounded like an 8 year old child. “Fuk u bitch.” \"I'm sorry?\" The voice came back louder, yet not deeper nor more resonant. \"Fuck you bitch\" This didn’t phase John at all, it was just a little baby! To play it safe, John ran up to the roof of the building, set the hat on fire, and then threw it into a devil's pit of fireworks and gasoline, then smothered what was left with the strike of god itself, more gasoline. Before doing so, however, John choose the hat a name for it’s last dying wish - “Die, Angry Hat.” The next day, John’s paranoia had reached an all time high, and another bust would ruin him. He had only till the store closed to finish what he had started days before, and the pressure was getting to him. Jack scrambled, he beat to and fro, he whisked, and he poured. The eggs were pretty good, however missing some salt. After that, John was ready to go, this time ready to make something even smaller and quicker than he had ever done before. In just three hours John had made his first sock of two, a new record, but he hadn't nailed down the personality. Too much was in doubt, and he wasn't quite sure what went wrong the last two times. So, anxious, he bit his knuckles as he set the sock in place, ready to speak to it. He didn’t know how it was going to turn out. Would it’s small size make it more infantile? More annoying? More angry? He wasn’t sure. So to test it’s intellect and temperment, he asked it a simple question, “Hey, what is the nearest lake to our city?” The sock immediately responded, much to the surprise of John, “Well Lake Limbaugh is the closest of course! - Just 13 miles to the West, can't miss it!” The sock spoke in an welcoming, upbeat tone, like a ticket server or what John imagined a butler sounded like. John checked a world atlas to make sure... he didn’t actually know the answer, and the sock was right! John continued to speak to it, he was enlightened by every answer. The sock was cordial, it was funny, it always included you in the conversation. It took all the energy in the room, but gave twice what it took. John talked to it, laughed and shared stories for hours. He talked so much, he forgot to make a second sock! John was about to freak out, what was going to happen? The client was supposed to get there in twenty minutes? Will he be happy with a *sock?* However, John's new stiched friend was understanding, and promised the client would understand. John believed the sock over himself. Finally, once the client got there, the client was in awe. He wore a top hat, had a danglingly monocle balanced on his face, and his fancy coattails were nearly brushing the floor. He attempted to hang his coat on the coathanger by the door, but John recconed against it. The client looked at the sock from every angle, asked every question, he spun the sock around, threw it in the air, and they were both laughing and playing together. It made him a kid again. He, after another swift twenty minutes of pure happiness and joy, started to address John, who was grinning ear to ear the whole time. The client addressed John as if he was a life long frined, in a small shout, not realising the room was dead silent. His top hat and monocle were tilted and unadjusted from his jumping and playing, “This sock… This sock… Well, it’s amazing!” “Thank you.” John responded, mimicking a cordial bow. “This sock… This sock… It’s enlightening!” “Thank you.” John again bowed, for what seemed like the twentieth yet second time “This sock is so great, I shall pay *twice* what I offered you before!” John lit up, “Oh, thank you sir!” He called out, in genuine excitement The client continued, oggling his feet, “This sock is so wonderful, I don’t want another! It would split my attention between the two!” John nodded. Feeling lucky the client was happy that his feet wouldn’t match. “This sock is so wonderful I shall tell *all* the papers about it! Everyone should know your wonderful craft. Oh how gobsmackingly merry it is! Simply wonderful.” This was the best day of John’s life. “This sock, what should I call this sock? You must have a name? Right?”’ John paused, he hadn't made one yet. He considered his options, and remembered the first word he spoke to this pleasant, elated, joyful, wonderful sock. And then he named it. “Hey, Nice Sock.”"}

The boy is so excited and feels like it takes forever for the big day to arrive. Finally, it’s time to go to the circus. They arrive early and get front row seats, sodas and peanuts. First the jugglers come out, and then the lion tamers, and then the elephants, and even motorcycle stunt riders do their tricks. Finally, a tiny car rolls out into the arena. A clown gets out, then another and another until 10 clowns have climbed out. They start doing tricks and fooling around and the whole crowd is cracking up. Then the lead clown speaks to the crowd and starts telling jokes. Eventually, he asks who is sitting in seat #13. The boy looks down and realizes that he’s in seat 13. He stands up and waves his hands and the clown points at the boy and says “You’re a horses ass!” and the whole crowd points and laughs. The boy is devastated and runs out of the arena. For days the boy mopes around until finally his parents, being worried about his state of mind decide to take him to a therapist. After the first session the therapist pulls the dad to the side and explains that the boy is broken-hearted because he’d never been insulted like that and didn’t know how to respond. The therapist recommended a school that specialized in comebacks, that maybe that would restore the boy’s confidence. The father agreed. The boy enrolled in the comeback school and quickly realized that he was a natural. With his gifts he quickly became the head of his class. He did so well that he wound up going to comeback high school, and then into comeback college. He was even accepted into a prestigious post-grad program, where he got his PhD in comebacks. He was an adult, and ready to take on the world. He finally got his opportunity when he saw a flyer announcing that the circus was coming to town. He couldn’t wait. A couple of weeks and he’d finally get his chance. The big day arrives and he gets to the circus early, front row seats, #13 just like he’d planned. He got his soda and peanuts too. The circus hadn’t changed much. First came the jugglers, then the lion tamers, elephants and stunt riders. Then came the clown car. Out of the car came the clowns, one after another. They did their gags and tricks and then the lead clown starts talking to the crowd, telling his jokes. Finally, he asks who is sitting in seat 13. The man stands up and confidently shouts “I am.” The clown points at him and says “You’re a horses ass!” As the crowd looks at the man he points back and shouts “FUCK YOU CLOWN!”"}

{"prompt": "April and June were dating...", "completion": "The couple had been together many years, and, as far as one could tell from the outside were very happy together. But June had always felt as though there was something between them, something holding them back- something that April was keeping a secret. As time went by, June got the impression that April was drifting away, and becoming colder. With every day, it felt as though the gap between them grew wider and wider. June had a suspicion as to what the cause might be- a little hussy by the name of May, who lived on the way from April's home to June's. June had seen the way May always made eyes at April when they walked past... she always looked smug, as though she knew something June didn't. One day, the paranoia became simply too much for June. With nowhere else to turn, June enlisted the help of August, a private investigator, to track April's movements, and find out if there really were some grounds to June's fears. August, a diligent detective, set about the task immediately, watching April night and day. No single action, no matter how trivial, escaped August's notice. Each detail was meticulously recorded in a journal. One day, about a week later, there was a knock at June's door. Nervous to the point of shaking, June opened the door to find August, journal in hand, and with a solemn expression. \"I have bad news, June...\" \"What? What is it?\" June panicked, grabbing August by the collar. \"Tell me!\" \"I... don't know how to say this, June... I'm sorry. Read the last entry...\" With a grimace, August handed June the notebook, already open to the most recent page. June's eyes scanned down the rows of neat notes, to the very last ones, listed as occuring just 20 minutes prior: April showers. Brings May flowers."}

{"prompt": "A man is driving late at night when his car breaks down in front of a remote Buddhist monastery.", "completion": "He knocks on the door and the monks open it. He tells the monks about his situation, and how he can't call for a mechanic at those hours of the night, so he asks them if he can stay the night in the monastery. The monks happily agree, and give him a room with a bed to sleep on. In the middle of the night, the man wakes up hearing a strange noise. He follows the noise and sees that its source is a strange door made of wood, but it's locked. The following morning, the monks give the man breakfast and fix his car. He thanks the monks and asks them: \"Honorable monks, I cannot thank you enough for your generosity, but I must ask you a question. Last night I heard a strange noise coming from behind a locked wooden door, and I'm dying to know what the source of the noise is.\" The leader of the monks responds: \"We cannot tell you, because you are not a monk.\" The man thanks the monks again and leaves disappointed. A year goes by, and the man coincidentally breaks down in front of the same monastery. He knocks on the door again and they greet him as an old friend, giving him once again a bed to sleep on. In the middle of the night, the man hears the same strange noise, and follows it again to see it's coming from the same wooden door, which is still locked. In the morning, the monks once again gave him breakfast and fixed his car, and as he was about to leave the man once again implored the monks to know what was behind the wooden door: \"Thank you once again, kind monks. It has been one whole year and I still wonder what the source of the strange noise is, as I've heard it again last night.\" The monks all look at each other and cackle. The leader once again steps forward and tells the man: \"We cannot tell you, because you are not a monk.\" The man leaves frustrated once again, and doesn't stop thinking about the strange noise for months. Two years later, the man coincidentally breaks down in front of the monastery once again, and once again the monks give him shelter. The man hears the strange noise in the night again, and in the morning asks the monks: \"Please, kind monks. I must know the source of the noise, I beg you.\" The monks explain to the man once again: . \"We cannot tell you, because you are not a monk.\" The man asks them what he has to do to become a monk. They tell him he must travel the world and count all the leaves in the world's trees, all the blades in the world's grass, all the grains of the world's sand, and all the drops of water in the world's oceans. He must return with the exact number, and only then will he become a monk and be able to learn the source of the sound. The man sets out on his quest to become a monk, and 65 years later returns to the monastery as an old man. \"I have traveled the world,\" he said. \"I have counted every leaf in the trees, every blade of grass, every grain of sand, and every drop in the ocean. There are 1572794709088 leaves in the world's trees, 3651870612479 blades of grass in the world, 6810379165872 grains of sand in the world, and 10752899766394 drops of water in the world's oceans.\" \"Congratulations,\" the leader of the monks said. \"You are now a monk. Please, come with us.\" The monks took the man to an initiation ceremony. They gave him his robes and shaved all his hair. The man requested to be taken to the wooden door to learn the source of the strange sound, so the monks took him and gave him the key. The man opened the wooden door, just to find a door made of stone behind it. He asked for the key to the stone door, and the monks gave it to him. He opened the stone door to find a door of coal behind it. One by one, the man kept unlocking and opening doors. After the door of coal he found a door of glass, then a door of iron, then a door of steel, then a door of bronze, then a door of silver, then a door of ruby, then a door of sapphire, then a door of emerald, then a door of gold, then a door of platinum, then a door of diamond, and finally a door of obsidian. \"This is the final door,\" said the leader of the monks. \"Behind it you will find the source of the strange sound.\" The monks handed the man the key to the door of obsidian and, as he opened it, the man finally found the source of the strange sound... But I cannot tell you, because you are not a monk."}
